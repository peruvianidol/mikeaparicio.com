I'm interested in helping companies large and small improve collaboration between design and development through the use of design systems. I have over 25 years experience making websites for individual entrepreneurs to large companies and everything in between. My background includes experience in computer science, design, journalism, public speaking, photography and video production, among other things. So while you might find a better designer or developer, you're unlikely to find someone who can apply all of those skills in a single role.

Here you'll find some detailed information on some of the work I've done throughout my career. If you're looking for the abridged version, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeaparicio/).
