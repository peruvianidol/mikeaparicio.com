  <p>I spoke with Dan Mall at Superfriendly on <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/podcasts/get-it-out-of-your-system/mike-aparicio-groupon-communication/">Get It Out of Your System</a> about how communication is one of the biggest challenges in establishing a design system.</p>

  <p>On the <a href="https://commandzpodcast.com/podcast/episodio-35-mike-aparicio-design-systems-more-than-just-a-library/">Command Z Podcast</a>, I talked to Layshi Curbelo about how design systems help improve collaboration between designers and engineers.</p>

  <p>At University of Illinois' 2019 WebCon, I gave a talk called <a href="/webcon/">Lessons From the Coupon Factory</a>, where I shared the evolution of Groupon's design system.</p>
