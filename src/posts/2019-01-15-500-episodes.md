I've been listening to podcasts regularly for over twelve years now, and my favorite one, The Slashfilmcast, just released its 500th episode. I remember tuning in to the very first episode in May of 2008 as they reviewed Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

Even though the movie was terrible, I really enjoyed the rapport between the hosts, Dave Chen, Devindra Hardawar, Adam Quigley and their guests. Each week I'd tune in to hear them chat about the latest film news, the movies and TV shows they had watched that week and in-depth discussions of new movie releases.

Over time I felt like I got to know the hosts, as I spent about as much time listening to them each week as I did talking to some of my friends and family. Adam left the show at one point and another host, Jeff Cannata, joined the podcast full-time and brought a whole new dynamic to the show.

It's been great watching the lives and careers of the hosts (and their many guests) develop over more than ten years. What began as a passion project led to many creative and professional opportunities for the Slashfilmcast crew.

A few years ago, when I was grieving the death of my daughter, I was at an absolute low point in my life. I was watching Dave play The Division on Twitch and was offering him tips in the comments. He invited me to join their party and we started playing pretty regularly. He introduced me to some of his gaming friends and over the past few years we've had a blast together playing games like Rocket League, Destiny, and Fortnite and chatting in Slack.

Being welcomed into the group and having a regular group of friends to game with really lifted my spirits at a time when I needed it most. For that, I will always be grateful.

500 episodes is a remarkable achievement. Podcasts come and go, but the consistency and longevity of the Slashfilmcast is really something to be celebrated. If you're a fan of film, I highly recommend you check it out!

Congrats Dave, Devindra and Jeff! And thanks for providing us with hours of insight and entertainment!
