For the last five years, I've been participating in [Extra Life](https://extra-life.org) to raise money for [Lurie Children's Hospital](https://www.luriechildrens.org) in Chicago. My daughter, [Olivia](https://mikeaparicio.com/posts/2018-08-26-four-years/), was born prematurely around that time and was being treated there. Extra Life was an opportunity to help kids at Lurie while doing something I love — playing video games — for 24 hours straight.

Olivia passed away just days after my first Extra Life marathon. Since then, I've participated each year as a way to honor her memory and each year I'm humbled by the support we've received. My friends Bert and Alan have since joined "Team Olivia," doing the marathon with me and helping to raise funds. Together we've raised $13,830 for Lurie Children's Hospital.

Last year, we blew our previous record away, raising an incredible $3,815. Each year I worry that we won't reach our previous total, but each year old donors and new continue to amaze us with their generosity.

This **November 2nd**, we'll be doing our SIXTH annual Extra Life marathon and would greatly appreciate your support! There are many ways you can help, including:

* **Support our cause by [Making a Donation](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.participant&participantID=404053).** Every bit helps!
* Join Team Olivia to help us raise funds and play with us on game day. You can visit our [team page](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&teamID=50937) and click the "Join Our Team" button.
* Spread the word about our cause. You can link to our team page at <https://extra-life.org/team/olivia> or to this blog post, or share/retweet any posts I make about the event.
* Tune in to our [live stream on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/peruvianidol) on November 2nd. We'll be kicking things off at 8am Central time and gaming for 24 hours straight. Pop into the chat and offer some words of encouragement.

Thank you so much for all of your love and support as we continue to keep Olivia's memory alive through helping other sick children!
