One month from today I'll be participating in my **SEVENTH** [Extra Life](https://extra-life.org), a 24-hour gaming marathon supporting local children's hospitals. Last year we raised a record **$5,120** for [Lurie Children's Hospital](https://www.luriechildrens.org/) here in Chicago. To date, thanks to the generosity of people like you, we've raised over **$20,000** to help sick kids.

Extra Life is a charity that is dear to my heart. In 2014, my daughter [Olivia](/posts/2018-08-26-four-years/) was born prematurely and received treatment at Lurie. Sadly, she passed just after my first Extra Life. Since then I've continued to participate to honor her memory, along with my friends Bert and Alan.

Each year we seem to top the previous year's fundraising goal. This year will be especially challenging given the pandemic, but it also means that your help is needed more than ever. There are several ways you can help the cause:

* **[Make a Donation](https://idol.pe/team-olivia)**. Every bit helps!
* Join Team Olivia to help us raise funds and play with us on game day. You can visit our [team page](https://extra-life.org/team/olivia) and click the "Join Our Team" button. You can choose any hospital in the Children's Hospital Network to support.
* Spread the word about our cause. You can link directly to our team page at [https://extra-life.org/team/olivia](https://extra-life.org/team/olivia) or to this blog post, or share/retweet any posts that I make about the event.
* Tune in to our live stream on Twitch on **Saturday, November 14th**. We'll be kicking things off at 8am Central and gaming for 24 hours straight. Pop into the chat and offer some words of encouragement!

Extra Life game day is normally the first Saturday in November, but I decided to do it a week later since the PlayStation 5 is coming out on the 12th. Look forward to checking out some next-gen games!

Thank you so much for your love and support as we continue to keep Olivia's memory alive through helping other sick children!
