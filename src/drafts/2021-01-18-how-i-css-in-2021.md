Last summer I left Groupon, where I spent almost nine years developing three CSS frameworks (for consumer, merchant and internal products) and a cross-platform design system. One of my old Groupon managers reached out, needing help getting his new company's design system off the ground, so I joined Provi, a small startup whose app connects alcohol retailers and distributors.

As part of my initial audit of Provi's existing process, I conducted a survey of engineers, product folks and our sole product designer at that time to get a sense of the challenges they face in getting features from concept to production. Almost unanimously, people noted that the extra time it takes developers to implement designs _accurately_ was their biggest challenge, **adding up to 40% extra time to a project.**

About a year ago I tweeted this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet ma-flow-24"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Company: Sorry, we‚Äôre looking for someone with more React experience.</p>
<p>Also Company:</p>

In case you can't tell from the picture, the company in question is loading **more than 650k of CSS**, according to [CSS Stats](https://cssstats.com).

Somehow Provi's CSS was even more.

The good news is, there's lots of room for improvement! But where to begin? I would have to introduce Provi to a new way of thinking about CSS and help reduce the amount of time they spend struggling with it. Since I have to document it anyway, I thought I'd share it here as well.

Now [the last time I wrote about CSS](/posts/2014-08-10-css-at-groupon/) in 2014, a bunch of people (and by "people", I mean it was 100% dudes) were like, "well, yes, obviously that's how you would do it. Everyone knows that." Or, "I just do all my CSS in JavaScript."

If you're one of those people, **this article is not for you**. Congratulations, you mastered CSS. Here's a cookie, as [Tatiana Mac](https://tatianamac.com/) would say. üç™

<h3 class="ma-heading-3">Where do we start?</h3>

Many moons ago, Dave Rupert advocated for [tiny Bootstraps, for every client](https://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/). That's essentially how I've approached CSS since my early days at Groupon. But how do you tackle a project with one person while also under pressure to ship new features? 

At Provi, we use new features to inform the design system's CSS framework and help us prioritize what's needed, rather than making a comprehensive list of everything that we ultimately want in the system. As we build new features, we'll need to add less and less code to our CSS framework, providing us time to go back and refactor other areas of the product, particularly the main funnel customers take through the site/app.

Before starting on the framework, however, I did a quick audit of existing styles to help narrow our visual styles down to a reasonable set of design tokens.
