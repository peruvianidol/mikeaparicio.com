A few weeks ago I started a new job at Provi as the Senior Design Systems Engineer. After working at Groupon for almost nine years, it's refreshing to be on a much smaller team, working on a more focused product. But it also means I don't have the luxury of spending months researching and getting buy-in across the organization. I had to come in and hit the ground running.

As part of my initial audit of Provi's existing process, I conducted a survey of engineers, product folks and our sole product designer to get a sense of the challenges they face in getting features from concept to production. Almost unanimously, people noted that the extra time it takes developers to implement CSS was the biggest challenge, **adding up to 40% extra time to a project.**

Back in February I tweeted this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet ma-flow-24"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Company: Sorry, we‚Äôre looking for someone with more React experience.</p>
<p>Also Company:</p>

In case you can't tell from the picture, the company in question is loading **more than 650k of CSS**, according to [CSS Stats](https://cssstats.com).

Somehow Provi's CSS was even more.

The good news is, there's lots of room for improvement! But where to begin? I would have to introduce Provi to a new way of thinking about CSS and help reduce the amount of time they spend struggling with it. Since I have to document it anyway, I thought I'd share it here as well.

Now [the last time I wrote about CSS](/posts/2014-08-10-css-at-groupon/) in 2014, a bunch of people were like, "well, yes, obviously that's how you would do it. Everyone knows that." Or, "I just do all my CSS in JavaScript."

If you're one of those people, **this article is not for you**. Congratulations, you mastered CSS. Here's a cookie, as [Tatiana Mac](https://tatianamac.com/) would say. üç™

<h3 class="ma-heading-3">Where do we start?</h3>

Many moons ago, Dave Rupert advocated for [tiny Bootstraps, for every client](https://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/). That's essentially how I've approached CSS since my early days at Groupon. But how do you tackle a project with one person while also under pressure to ship new features? 

We want to use the new features to inform the design system's CSS framework and help us prioritize what's needed, rather than making a comprehensive list of everything that we ultimately want in the system. As we build new features, we'll need to add less and less code to our CSS framework and it should provide us time to go back and refactor other areas of the product, particularly the main funnel customers take through the site/app.

But first, I start by taking inventory of how three key visual elements are used throughout the product: **color**, **type** and **space**.

<h3 class="ma-heading-3">Color</h3>

Fortunately, despite having a lot of CSS, Provi's product already has a pretty consistent color palette. All that is really needed is to test the color palette's contrast to ensure it meets accessibility standards and make a few tweaks where it doesn't.

Given that we need to also ship features as we build the system, we can use the existing palette for now and change the color values later via design tokens.

I've written about [design tokens](/posts/2020-07-06-simple-groupon/) before but, in short, they're basically variables on steroids. There are three types of tokens: **Global**, **Contextual**, and **Component**. For now, we're just concerned with our Global tokens, which represent all the values available in the system.

```css
// Color
$color-brand-primary: #002B48;
$color-brand-secondary: #008FBE;
$color-red: #CD5858;
$color-green: #47B881;
$color-green-light: #A8FFAF;
$color-yellow: #ECC032;
$color-white: #FFFFFF;
$color-black: #0F1924;
$color-gray-dark: #4C5B60;
$color-gray: #A1AEB2;
$color-gray-cart: #D9DEE0;
$color-gray-light: #F5F7F7;
$color-black-60pct: rgba(0,0,0,.6);
```
We'll probably update the color names and values as we go, but this is a great start.

<h3 class="ma-heading-3">Type</h3>

The next thing we need is a solid type scale. Rather than be concerned with font weight and color, we can go through the app an pull out the most common text sizes to start with.

Typically we'll need about 4-5 heading sizes and 2-4 text sizes, and there might be some overlap there when you factor in the different contexts these sizes might be used in. All together you're probably looking at 6-8 font sizes, with enough differentiation to create a clear heirarchy.

```css
// Type
$heading-1-font-size: 2rem        // 32px
$heading-1-line-height: 2.375rem; // 38px
$heading-2-font-size: 1.5rem;     // 24px
$heading-2-line-height: 2.125rem; // 34px
$heading-3-font-size: 1.25rem;    // 20px
$heading-3-line-height: 1.75rem;  // 28px
$heading-4-font-size: 1.125rem;   // 18px
$heading-4-line-height: 1.5rem;   // 24px

$text-large-font-size: 1.125rem;  // 18px
$text-large-line-height: 1.5rem;  // 24px
$text-medium-font-size: 1rem;     // 16px
$text-medium-line-height: 1.5rem; // 24px
$text-small-font-size: .875rem;   // 14px
$text-small-line-height: 1.25rem; // 20px
$text-tiny-font-size: .75rem;     // 12px
$text-tiny-line-height: 1.125rem; // 18px
```

I decided to pair the font sizes and line heights so that people aren't tempted to create odd combinations. Besides that, these values are typically paired in Sketch or Figma's type styles.

These tokens are kind of a weird combination of Global and Component level tokens, which I'll talk more about later.
