Our hearts are broken. On Thursday night our beloved dog, Geno, passed away. He had been sick for a few months but the last couple of weeks really took their toll on him.

Gee-Gee was the best guard dog, an eager snuggler, incredibly patient and gentle with the kids, and integral part of our family. We love him and miss him so much.
