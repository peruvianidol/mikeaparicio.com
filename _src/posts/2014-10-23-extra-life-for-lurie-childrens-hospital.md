This Saturday, starting at 8:00am Central, I'll be playing video games for 24 hours straight to raise money for [Extra Life](http://www.extra-life.org/). All proceeds will go to [Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago](https://www.luriechildrens.org/), where my daughter Olivia is being treated. Olivia was born prematurely after just 24 weeks but has received amazing care from the staff of Lurie Children's Hospital. I'm very happy to be able to give something back while doing something I love at the same time.

I'll be streaming live on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/peruvianidol) all day. Come by and say hello, and please consider [donating](http://extra-life.org/participant/peruvianidol) if you can. Thanks for your support!
