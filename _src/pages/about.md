I'm **Mike Aparicio**, a.k.a. Peruvian Idol. I was born and raised in the Chicago area and, aside from a two year stint in California, have lived here my whole life. I started my first website, Mikey's Chicago Bulls Page, after flunking out of the University of Illinois in 1994 and have been making them ever since.

I spent most of my career as a general "web guy" before joining Groupon in 2011. At Groupon, I built in-house CSS frameworks for our internal tools, consumer, and merchant websites and helped build a cross-platform design system. In 2020, I went to Provi, where I led the development of their design system, Fizz. <!--I'm currently the {{ site.role }}.-->

I occasionally stream [Office Hours on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/peruvianidol), where I talk about and answer questions on design systems, CSS, Eleventy and other stuff, while doing a bit of live-coding.

Some of my active side-projects include [11ty Recipes](https://11ty.recipes), a collection of step-by-step instructions for adding new features to Eleventy sites, and [Dogs of Dev](https://dogsof.dev), a website that's just pictures of dogs of people who make websites.

I did the writing and conservatory programs at Second City, which was as close as I'd come to fulfilling my childhood dream of being on Saturday Night Live. I wrote and performed sketch and improv comedy and collaborated on a few short [comedy videos](https://vimeo.com/peruvianidol) with my classmates.

I also enjoy playing video games. I've participated in [Extra Life](https://www.extra-life.org/), a 24-hour gaming marathon, every year since 2014 to support Lurie Children's Hospital in honor of my daughter, [Olivia](http://localhost:8080/posts/2018-08-26-four-years/). To date, we've raised over **$38,000** for Lurie.

I live in Oak Park, Illinois, with my wife, three sons and two dogs.
