I'm **Mike Aparicio**, a.k.a. Peruvian Idol. I was born and raised in the Chicago area and, aside from a two year stint in California, have lived here my whole life. I started my first website, Mikey's Chicago Bulls Page, after flunking out of the University of Illinois in 1994 and have been making them ever since.

I spent most of my career as a general "web guy" before joining Groupon in 2011. At Groupon, I built in-house CSS frameworks for our internal tools, consumer, and merchant websites and helped build a cross-platform design system. I'm currently the Senior Design Systems Engineer at [Provi](https://provi.com).

Some of my recent side-projects include [11ty Recipes](https://11ty.recipes), a collection of step-by-step instructions for adding new features to Eleventy sites, and [Dogs of Dev](https://dogsof.dev), a website that's just pictures of dogs of people who make websites.

Every Friday from 1-3pm Central time I stream [**Office Hours**](https://twitch.tv/peruvianidol) on Twitch, where you can ask me questions about CSS, design systems and Eleventy. I sometimes also work on projects and catch up on dev-related articles in one of my many open tabs.

I did the writing and conservatory programs at Second City, which was as close as I'd come to fulfilling my childhood dream of being on Saturday Night Live. I wrote and performed sketch and improv comedy and collaborated on a few short [comedy videos](https://vimeo.com/peruvianidol) with my classmates.

I also enjoy playing video games. I've participated in [Extra Life](https://www.extra-life.org/), a 24-hour gaming marathon, every year since 2014 to support [Lurie Children's Hospital](https://www.luriechildrens.org/) in honor of my daughter, [Olivia](/posts/2018-08-26-four-years/). To date, we've raised **over $25,000** for Lurie.

I live in Oak Park, Illinois, with my wife, two sons and two dogs.
