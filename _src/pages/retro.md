Hello, fellow Turquee! Congratulations on winning one of the retro handhelds at the Austin Summit!

Both the [Anbernic RG351P](https://anbernic.com/products/rg351p-anbernic-retro-game-ps1-rk3326-64g-open-source-system-3-5-inch-ips-screen-portable-handheld-game-console-rg351gift-2401) and [Anbernic RG353V](https://anbernic.com/products/rg353v-rg353vs) are pre-loaded with some classic games and should be ready to play right out of the box. When you're in a game, you can press the start and select buttons at the same time to quit back to the list of games.

I think one or both of them have HDMI out so you can hook it up to a TV and play on a big screen.

Both systems are running a custom OS called [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos). You can find FAQs for each system here:

* [RG351P](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---RG351P)
* [RG353V](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---RG353V)

You can find more games at the [r/Roms Megathread](https://r-roms.github.io/megathread/retro/). A few systems have different types of files and only certain ones will work on these devices. Specifically, for NES games you want the "headerless" variety, and for Dreamcast you want `.chd` files.

To add new games, download them to your computer and transfer them to the microSD card. (I use this [Anker SD card reader](https://a.co/d/3mxQEaf).) The RG351P has a single SD card that contains both the OS and the games (in a folder called `ROMS`), while the RG353V has one SD card for the OS (on the top) and a separate SD card for games (on the bottom). Place the files in the the appropriate folder for the system the game is for. [This list](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/ArkOS-Emulators-and-Ports-information) contains all the supported systems and the folder names, in case you want to add games for a system that isn't included by default. (Arcade, Atari, TurboGraphix, for example.)

[Retro Game Corps](https://retrogamecorps.com/) has a great collection of guides and reviews of these and other retro handhelds.

If you run into any issues or have any questions, hit me up in Slack and I'll be happy to help you out!

Enjoy!
