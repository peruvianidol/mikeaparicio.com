I'm interested in helping companies large and small improve collaboration between design and development through the use of design systems. I have over 25 years experience making websites for individual entrepreneurs to large companies and everything in between. My background includes experience in computer science, design, journalism, public speaking, photography and video production, among other things. So while you might find a better designer or developer, you're unlikely to find someone who can apply all of those skills in a single role.

Here you'll find some detailed information on some of the work I've done throughout my career. If you're looking for the abridged version, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeaparicio/).

Inspired by the awesome pups of fellow web designers and developers, I created Dogs of Dev to serve as a sanctuary from all the doomscrolling, shit posting, and political discourse that sours our everyday Internet experience. Dogs of Dev is just a place to look at cute dogs.

11ty Recipes is the site I wish existed when I got started with the static site generator, Eleventy. There are lots of great starter sites out there, but they tend to include a lot of features that you may or may not want. 11ty Recipes offers step-by-step instructions on adding each individual feature to your Eleventy site.
