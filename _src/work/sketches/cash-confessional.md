<p class="ma-block">I wrote this sketch in the writing program while doing the conservatory at the same time. I pitched this for our final conservatory show and with the collaboration of my director and castmates, it turned into something really fun. Here's <a href="https://vimeo.com/29731606">a pretty sub-par recording</a> of one of our performances. I'd hoped to shoot a YouTube video of this but just never got around to it.</p>

<p class="ma-dir">(A Priest sits in a confession booth. Ryan enters, makes the sign of the cross.)</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been two weeks since my last confession.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong> (solemnly)</p>
<p>Well, my son, you are in luck...</p>

<p class="ma-dir">(Light's flash and a short, instrumental theme plays.)</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong> (TV game show host voice)</p>
<p>...because you're in the Cash Confessional! It's a TV game show that takes place right here in my confession booth!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>What?! Really??</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>That's right! So what do you say, do you want to play?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Yes I do!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Great! What's your name?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Umm, Ryan Cho.</p>

<p>Alright, Ryan, here's how the game works. For each sin you confess, I'll ask you a trivia question. If you get it right, not only will you be absolved of your sin, but you'll also win some cold, hard cash!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Yes, please!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Okay, Ryan. Let's get started. What is your first confession?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Oh, uh, last Sunday I skipped mass to watch football.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>I see. Well, then this first question should be right up your alley then! Which N.F.L. team has won the most Super Bowls?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Oh, uh, the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>The is correct! You are absolved of your sin and you just won $50!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Good!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>That is good! Alright, Ryan, what is your next confession?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Uh... well, I took the Lord's name in vain several times... just today.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>I see. Well, any good Catholic should know the answer to this question. What is the chosen name of the current Pope?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Oh, jeez. Umm, Pope... Benedict... the... 15th?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>No, I'm sorry! It's Benedict the 16th. SIX-teenth.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>FUCK!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Ok, well... you've got your first strike, two more and you will lose all of your money and burn in hell for all eternity.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Wait, what?!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>But the good news is these next questions are worth $100 each! 

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Oh! Okay!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>But we'll really need to hear some juicier confessions, Ryan. So, what is your next confession?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>I, uh, I was at work and uh, this female co-worker... I had impure thoughts about her.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Okaaaaay! Ryan, which H.B.O. television series is based on a series of novels by author George R.R. Martin?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Oh, that's gotta be Game of Thrones!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>I'm afraid that's... CORRECT! $100 plus absolution means you're now up to $150 with just one strike!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Wonderful! I smoked marijuana last Saturday.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Wow, you're really getting the hang of this!</p>

<p class="ma-dir">(Organ riff plays)</p>

<p>Oh, that sound means it's time for a BIBLE CHALLENGE! Here's how the Bible Challenge works. It's a multiple answer question and if you get all parts of the answer correct it's worth an additional $500 dollars. There's no penalty for wrong answers, so just call out anything you think might be a part of it until you get all of them right or time runs out. If you miss it, you don't get a strike, you don't lose any money, you just don't get the $500, and you have 30 seconds to answer from the time I finish asking. Are you ready?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, sure! Let's do it!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Ryan... name five of the 10 Commandments.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Umm... thou shall not kill?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Uh... thou shall not steal?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Correct.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Do not covet thy neighbor's wife.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Oh man... uh... something about the Sabbath? Don't... rest? No work?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>You'll need to be more specific!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>You have to go to church?</p>

<p class="ma-dir">(buzzer sounds)</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry but you're out of time! 

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>GOD DAMMIT!!!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>It's okay, Ryan. You still have just one strike and $150, okay? So, let's just move on. What's your next confession?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>I, umm, I pleasured myself... um... several times... just today.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Okay, uhhh... Ryan, what was the cause of death of singer/songwriter Amy Winehouse?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Ahhh, can I use my Congregation Shout-out?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Of course!</p>

<p class="ma-dir">(Ryan opens the confessional door and addresses the audience.)</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Does anyone know the cause of death of Amy Winehouse?</p>

<p class="ma-dir">(Audience shouts out various answers.)</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you! (to Priest) I will say... [audience suggestion]?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorry, the correct answer is God's will. God's will. That's two strikes, Ryan. One more and you'll lose all of your money and one day you'll have a close, intimate relationship with Satan... in the butt. But, hey, these next questions are worth $200 each, but Ryan, seriously, I'm gonna need to hear some reaaaally juicy confessions, okay? I mean, c'mon, everybody masturbates.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Let's see. What else, what else? Well, I got my girlfriend pregnant and convinced her to have an abortion.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Now we're talking! Ryan, which celebrity won the first season of Dancing with the Stars?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Ah, can I use my Mobile Shout-Out?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Certainly! Who would you like to call?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>My mom. It's her favorite show.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Alrighty, Almighty! Let's get Ryan's mother on the phone! Mrs. Cho, your son recently got his girlfriend pregnant and convinced her to have an abortion, and he has a question he'd like to ask you!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>MOTHER</strong></p>
<p>What?! Who is this?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Mom, who won the first season of Dancing with the Stars?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>15 seconds.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>MOTHER</strong></p>
<p>Ryan, is this true? You got Stacy pregnant and told her to get an abortion? Do you know that this is murder? You murdered my grandchild!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Mom! It's your favorite show!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>MOTHER</strong></p>
<p>Wait until I tell your father about this!</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Mom! There's money! Mom!</p>

<p class="ma-dir">(phone clicks)</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Did your mother just hang up on you?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Well, I'm going to need an answer.</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>RYAN</strong></p>
<p>I... I don't know. Flava Flav?</p>

<p class="ma-text-center"><strong>PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>Oh! So sorry. The correct answer is Kelly Monaco. Kelly Monaco. Ryan, that's your third strike, you've forfeited all of your money and any chance you had of getting into heaven... but thanks for playing Cash Confessional. Good night, everybody!</p>
