<h4>Thanks for reading!</h4>

<p>I'm <strong>Mike Aparicio</strong> Senior Design Systems Engineer at Provi. I'm interested in helping companies large and small improve collaboration between design and engineering through the use of design systems. I write about web design and development, video games, pop culture, and other things I find interesting. I live in the Chicago area with my wife, two sons, and two dogs.</p>
