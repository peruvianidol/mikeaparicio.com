      "reviewText": "This movie predicted Uber Eats, Zoom calls, AI agents, and self-driving cars and was directed by a guy whose only credit before this was apparently a C+C Music Factory video. It's not a top tier 90s action movie but it's incredibly watchable, largely thanks to Wesley Snipes' charisma and action chops and Sandra Bullock going all-in as Stallone's hopelessly optimistic and 20th century-loving partner. There are some fun action set pieces, including one of the most memorable demises of a villain. How this got made I have no idea but I wish they still made stuff like this."

      "reviewText": "Just a fun, sleazy, 80s crime movie featuring a pretty epic chase scene and one ridiculous turn after another. Willem Dafoe shines as an expert counterfeiter being pursued by two increasingly incompetent secret service agents. Not a great movie by any means but you can tell this probably inspired Tarantino and others to make similarly over-the-top crime capers."

      "reviewText": "I feel like maybe I saw this before but it was so forgettable that nothing stuck. I definitely remember the poster. Anyway, this movie is very 90s in just about every way. A modern-ish noir with lots of twists and turns and plot points that fall apart if you think about them for more than half a second. It's like a Lifetime movie made for Cinemax, with Denise Richards providing lots of male gaze bits. It's not a good movie by any means but it's pretty fun and trashy all the way through to the credits, where a bunch of stuff is revealed that happened off-camera."

      "reviewText": "This was more fun than I was expecting. Dog Man is the hero but it's really Pete Davidson's movie. There was a lot to relate to in being a parent and dog owner. At one point Petey asks L'il Petey, \"how come I made you but you're not like me?\" To which L'il Petey responds, \"maybe I am but you just don't like that part.\" That gutted me. Some great humor and 80s references for parents and came in at under 90 minutes."

      "reviewText": "There’s a vulnerability in acting that almost seems incongruous with prison life. Yet this story, about the real-life Rehabilitation Through the Arts program at Sing Sing, proves that wrong, blending fact with fiction with a cast of real RTA alums. Coleman Domingo gives a powerful performance and deserves all of the awards buzz. But the real standout for me was Clarence Maclin, one of the RTA members, who plays his vital arc with convincing nuance. A great pairing with Ghostlight, which also shows the redemptive power of theater."

Kidman is great, you don’t often see older women depicted in positions of power while also screwing a much younger guy. Dickinson is kind of an empty vessel here, but maybe that was the point.

      "reviewText": "A timely tale of the Norwegian resistance during WW2, and Norway’s most decorated hero, Gunnar Sønsteby. Framed by a Q&A many years after the war, Gunnar tells the audience of young Norwegians, “All these stories that you see that are published in the papers, they tell them. It’s the owners. What to print and what not to print. Every single time. So in the case of war, well, those papers should be lit instead. They’re mere kindling.” That really stuck with me given the current state of things. The flashbacks to the war are pretty standard fare, but Gunnar’s reckoning with his actions after being questioned by a young woman at the Q&A was quite poignant. Worth watching."

      "reviewText": "There’s a lot to love here, particularly Daniel Day-Lewis’ performance as Bill the Butcher. It feels like both DiCaprio and Diaz are miscast and Scorsese just tries to do too much at the end. There’s a lot of build-up to a climactic confrontation that’s largely disrupted by a historical event. This movie is probably more relevant to today’s political climate than it was in 2002. If only we could see we should be fighting the “$300 men” instead of each other."

It lists off problems that, to no one’s surprise, are bad! And if left unchecked, could lead to a disastrous future, as if it’s not already here. It asks us to take action before it’s too late but has no ideas about what those actions might be. One of the many problems it covers is AI, but it seems like AI was used to make the doc? 84 minutes of my life I’ll never get back."

      "reviewText": "Kyle Mooney's humor is definitely not for everyone but this movie had me laughing my ass off. Heavy on the late 90s nostalgia and includes maybe the best cameo of the year. Brilliantly spoofs movies of that era and mixes genres in a fun way. It's almost a millennial Wet Hot American Summer. Didn't love this as much as Brigsby Bear but was not disappointed."

The whole thing didn't add up to much, mostly because there's just not enough time to develop its characters. There's definitely some Heat and Sicario influences at play but The Order lacks the depth of those films. Might have been better as the next season of True Detective."

Looks better than the first movie just by virtue of using a better camera but lacks Danny Boyle's style. Great to see Jeremy Renner, Idris Elba and Rose Byrne before they were household names. Turns out bringing Americans in to solve your problems is maybe not the best idea."

I don't know that I ever saw him in anything else until after he passed. He was just always Superman. This doc mostly covers his life after being paralyzed, his advocacy for the disabled, and the family, friends, and legacy he left behind. It had me in tears for most of the last 20 minutes. It's devastating to see our heroes fall but some manage to rise up and be more heroic than ever. Reeve was certainly one of those heroes."

It’s truly a miracle that no one died making this movie, particularly Michelle Yeoh, who is absolutely fearless and very much Jackie’s equal in terms of skill and screen presence. The plot is ridiculously over-the-top but grounded with humor, like many of Jackie’s movies. Props to the stunt team who managed several set pieces on par with modern Mission: Impossible movies years earlier. There are very few movie stars that would risk their lives just to entertain us for a couple of hours but I’m glad they exist."
