      "reviewText": "Wasn’t expecting Jackie Chan, now in his 70s, to feature so prominently in this, but he’s here doing Jackie Chan shit. The direction and editing don’t do him any favors, with tight close-ups and quick cuts diminishing the action somewhat. There’s a fair amount of good action though and Macau is a pretty interesting setting. The movie is brought down by a ton of added melodrama around the aging villain and his Gen Z orphan gang, and the daughter of Jackie’s old partner, now also a cop, who Jackie has been secretly keeping an eye on since his partner was killed. The credits seem to hint at a sequel, though I’m not sure how much longer Jackie can keep banging these out."

The ending is just wild. This is probably the most serious I’ve seen Song Kang-ho, who normally injects his roles with humor. Here he’s just a man on a mission up until the very end."

      "reviewText": "This movie is a complete slog until it gets going. The first 40 minutes or so make Den of Thieves look like Citizen Kane. When it finally starts cooking, it’s mostly a mindless, glossy exercise, stacked with talent, like nearly every other high-profile Netflix original. But it’s hard to deny this cast elevates even the worst dreck to “watchable.” This could have been a tight 90 minutes if there wasn’t so much repetitive dialogue and exposition. Also, how are you gonna cast Scott Adkins and not have him kick all sorts of ass? Completely missed opportunity."

      "reviewText": "This is a horror movie about a woman stuck in purgatory who has to fix a man. Besides being played by a mediocre actor, there’s very little to indicate the man is even worth fixing. The movie finally starts to get interesting when the woman gives up on trying to fix the man and instead pursues her own interests and happiness but, of course, that doesn’t last long. Things finally take an inexplicable left turn that left me baffled in the end. This is a good looking movie, shot in beautiful locations, and the woman who plays Sore is very sympathetic. But just as her character struggles to change the man, she also struggles to carry this movie across the finish line by herself. What a frustrating endeavor."

      "reviewText": "This movie came out a year too early. Who would have thought when it was released we’d be living through another Trump administration, our neighbors being abducted, gassed, and shot to death. The idea of a civil war seemed implausible at best. Now this movie takes on a whole new relevance. Gorgeously shot and well-acted, I love how it builds this world with very little exposition. Though what we do learn still seems highly fantastical — that California and Texas would join forces against the president, that journalists would do anything but be a mouthpiece for the regime, that anyone formidable would stand up for us besides our own neighbors. Another year could see this become even more prescient. Hopefully it’s final shot most of all."

      "reviewText": "This was my favorite film of 2025, so was thrilled for it to come out on digital finally. Filled with moments of joy, beauty, heartache and connection, it moved me more than any other movie I saw last year. I really don’t get the “white savior” criticism this movie is getting. Brendan’s character is the audience surrogate, and his character is as affected by the people he meets as they are by him, if not more so. This movie only works because he is a gaijin. A Japanese person in the same role would just accept the cultural differences as normal and not have the same impact on their “customers”, if any at all. Brendan plays the part with an openness and curiosity that few other actors could pull off. And the girl who plays Mia is wonderful. Still needed a box of tissues on second watch."

It’s kind of a small miracle this movie got made at all. It still holds up 50 years later. Robert Shaw is especially great.

Connery looks bored here, surrounded by a bunch of familiar character actors like Young Frankenstein’s monster, Doogie Howser’s dad, Noah Wylie’s mom from ER and Lester Freemon from The Wire. Entertaining enough though."

It feels like a straight noir movie with a futuristic sheen. Its only mistake is that it presupposes that the people operating our dystopian, techno-fascist police state would be remotely competent."

Part of that is Blanc is not a particularly interesting character. Aside from being good at solving mysteries he doesn’t seem to have any other apparent skills or interests and instead seems to just serve as a way to provide exposition to the mystery.  This one has several memorable scenes and felt like the most personal of the three.

Great seeing a lot of the cast and hearing from fans and early podcasters about how the show changed their lives. Definitely got a little nostalgic and it gave me the itch to revisit the show."

From my kids’ perspective, the opening is great, and then it’s just people talking in the desert for like 30 minutes until anything remotely interesting happens. There’s some fun stuff on the Death Star and then the final assault, which this was the first time my kids made it that far. In the end they thought it was bullshit that Luke and Han got medals and they just left Chewbacca standing there like a goon.My oldest was shocked to learn they made more than one Star Wars movie."

Sure, this doc doesn’t offer a ton of insight into the man, but it’s a celebration of a body of work of over 40 years that has brought us so much joy and influenced countless others to follow in his footsteps. There’s nothing particularly illuminating here but Murphy does offer some nuggets of wisdom, hard won after surviving this long as one of the most famous people on Earth. Just seeing that smile and hearing that laugh is a joy. And it’s clear Murphy is far from finished."

Having been subjected to weeks of ICE and Border Patrol running amok here in Chicago, the opening scene feels so cathartic. From there it’s just a relentless ride with so much manic energy, save Benicio’s Sensei Sergio, who exudes cool calm when the movie reaches its most tense moments. On second viewing I totally get the criticism that this story of mostly women of color revolutionaries is centered largely around a couple of white guys. I wish we got more of Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall, who gets barely any screen time. But damn, what a ride."

Doesn’t shy away from some of the darker parts of his personality that are actually critical to his work. It was fascinating to see Marty’s contemporaries like De Palma and Spielberg, prolific directors in their own right, heaping praise and admiration on him, not to mention those whose work he influenced. My only quibble is that five episodes is somehow too short, glossing over his recent career and collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio.

He was in One Battle After Another, has a part in the new Tim Robinson series, The Paper Company, and now this documentary giving Jim his due as one of the most prolific comedy writers of the last 50 years. Glad to finally watch a doc that gives someone their flowers while they’re still with us. I only wish it was longer. You could easily do a Last Dance length documentary with all the material Downey has written."

It’s a pretty by-the-numbers courtroom drama absolutely stacked with recognizable character actors. The story is chillingly relevant. If the government wants to do something, it’s not hard for them to stack everything against you. Ostensibly the events depicted here were less likely to happen again once the Supreme Court guaranteed a right to civil trial even in times of war shortly after this trial happened. But if recent events haven’t made clear, laws don’t mean shit if the levers of power are held by unscrupulous men."

Filling in some gaps in his filmography with this one, which came out when I was in high school and everything about it looked boring as shit to me, a young idiot. Watching it for the first time now, as a parent of two boys similarly separated in age, I couldn’t help but wonder which will go on to be a professor, and which I’ll have to bail out of jail. This is a fine movie with great cinematography and earnest performances all around. Brad Pitt, pre superstardom, is particularly mesmerizing. It’s odd that Redford narrates as the older brother, and not Pitt, who is almost the spitting image of Redford in both looks and charm. Unfortunately the older brother is pretty dull by comparison. The ending really hit hard and made me realize I’d come to care for these characters, dullness and all. Not sure high school Mike would have felt the same though."

Love young Benicio Del Toro here as one of a pair of kidnappers who gets in over his head. Not to mention James Fucking Caan as a badass bagman rocking a Member’s Only jacket. There’s some great action here and memorable scenes. It’s incredible McQuarrie went on to direct huge action blockbusters. I’d love to see him revisit something on a smaller scale like this."

Spike Lee’s remake, on the other hand, replaces the police procedural element with… a Denzel movie. I love Spike and Denzel, but this remake, like Oldboy, is just completely unnecessary. The score is so overbearing, there’s almost never a moment when there’s no music and it doesn’t fit the vibe of the movie at all. The cops are poorly written and completely inept — the movie looks like an ad for the NYPD but then portrays its cops as dipshits, which, ok.Overall it doesn’t improve on Kurosawa’s in any way and doesn’t seem to have much to say by bringing it into the modern era. A huge swing and a miss by Spike."

      "reviewText": "I was interested in this because I haven’t seen many films shot in Peru or about its history. And while the film is largely fictional, it captures a time when the Spanish came to the land of the Incas and pretty much took whatever the fuck they wanted. The Spanish men in this film are largely brutish, greedy, and power hungry, while the native Peruvians seem resigned to their fate more than anything. It’s a hard movie to reckon with, since I likely wouldn’t be here otherwise, having both Spanish and native Peruvian ancestry. It’s pretty fascinating that they were even able to make this, filming chronologically on location in the Amazon. Kinski’s screen presence is riveting, his face practically chiseled from stone and his eyes bulging."

When the two meet some 25 years after the events of the film, their makeup makes them look even older than they do in real life, where nearly the same amount of time has passed since this was filmed.

      "reviewText": "Around the time this came out on cable I used to watch it all the time. It’s a goofy premise (which I only now learned was written by David Mamet, of all people) but DeNiro and Penn really sell it. DeNiro with his entire range of facial expressions and Penn with his earnestness. There’s also a spunky young Demi Moore, John C Reilly doing his thing, and Wallace Shawn. It’s almost cartoonishly silly, but it still tickled me all these years later."

Years later it’s obvious the movies that influenced it, but to mention them here would spoil the surprises. Suffice it to say, this movie still slaps. I love it unapologetically. The central cast is great, including an all-time monologue from Alec Baldwin about his “god complex.” Lots of great supporting actors pop up, including Anne Bancroft and a 21-year-old Gwenyth Paltrow. Also, I was shocked to learn it was co-written by Aaron Sorkin! When the final twist was revealed, I cackled out loud and it brought me back to that packed college theater where everyone was hooting and hollering."

Goldblum is perfectly cast as a twitchy nerd fused with a fly, his subtle mannerisms getting more fly-like throughout. For a relatively short movie, it drags at times, particularly all of the 80s obsession dudes had with getting laid. Still, the practical effects are still pretty amazing. A remake these days would probably be all CG and lose all of the magic."

However, I loved the relationship between Dantes and Luis Guzman’s Jacopo, who is present in the 2024 version but has no lines and the nature of their relationship is never mentioned. I also loved Richard Harris as Abbé Faria, much more playful in this version. Guy Pierce really chews up the scenery as the main target of Dante’s’ vengeance, while the other two are relegated to almost footnotes. Also 18-year-old Henry Cavill! This version is great in its own right. I’d say if you like this version and haven’t seen the 2024 one, they’re quite different in style and execution, you might enjoy it as well though."

The disguises require a bit of suspension of disbelief, but each one was great. Feels like it will reward rewatching. I’m curious now where this ranks among all the other versions.

It goes places both literally and figuratively that I wasn’t expecting. There are some extraordinary touches like a dash of color in an otherwise black and white movie, and the eerie reflection in the kidnapper’s sunglasses. The ending fell a little flat for me. I guess I’ve been conditioned by modern movies to expect big twist. It felt very Japanese. I can see why Spike’s remake is getting such tepid reviews. The bar is set pretty high here."

The change makes sense thematically but is undercut by the jarring uncanny valley of Clu, a digitized and de-aged Jeff Bridges. They should have leaned more into the imperfection. The plot is pretty nonsensical, not that the first one was incredible either. Bridges seems like he’s in full Lebowski mode here minus the laughs. The music and the aesthetic really carry this, but also show the beginnings of a style that Kosinski would go on to hone in Oblivion, Top Gun: Maverick, and F1."

I almost wish this were longer so we could get more Paul Walter Hauser as Drebin’s partner. There’s definitely some funny moments but I’d be hard pressed to recall any great lines, even less than an hour after getting out of the theater.

On paper, a Ridley Scott film written by Cormac McCarthy and starring this A-List cast seems like a sure fire hit. But what we get instead is a bunch of memorable scenes intercut with lots of talk about sex, and not in an interesting way. Half of the characters are like something out of a GTA game and the dialogue is so heavy-handed it doesn’t make sense coming out of these characters, even when it’s delivered by great actors. The whole thing adds up to very little because it seems the characters fall victim to their own actions which are only alluded to during the course of the movie, and their fates don’t really feel justified based on the plot of the movie. It’s just all so very random. But damn, Checkov’s Bolito."

      "reviewText": "There’s no reason for this sequel to exist besides the fact that Netflix dropped a boatload of money on Sandler. Despite that, this movie is a ton of fun. The plot is even thinner than the first but the sheer amount of jokes and cameos keep things interesting. Nearly all of the characters from 30 years ago make an appearance in some way (even the dead ones) and nearly all of them have offspring perfect for stunt casting. If, like me, you watched the original a bunch of times on VHS or cable TV in college, you’ll get a kick out of this."

      "reviewText": "Near the end of Mississippi Burning, Willem Dafoe’s FBI Agent Ward says, “Anyone’s guilty who watches this happen and pretends it isn’t.” As tough as the movie is to watch, some degree of justice is served at the end. But sadly enough, the guilty are now in the highest offices, inflicting greater wounds on larger swaths of people that aren’t like them. This was made some thirty years after the events depicted and now, 60 years on we haven’t done much better. This might be up there for Hackman’s greatest roles. The antithesis of his character in Unforgiven. Dafoe is also great as his partner, and there’s a slew of “that guy” to be found on both sides of the law. This movie is near perfect if only it had given its black characters as much depth and dialogue as it does its white characters. It’s left up to a bunch of white FBI agents to save the day which, in retrospect, seems highly implausible."

      "reviewText": "The bar for recent Marvel movies is pretty low, and even lower for Fantastic Four movies, so I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this. I loved the retro-future aesthetic (spotted one of Chicago’s iconic Marina Towers at one point) and the chemistry between all the members was great and believable. This is the first Marvel movie in forever where it didn’t feel like you needed to do homework to follow the story, and they weren’t adding a bunch of storylines to set up the next thing. There’s no glowing MacGuffin and the stakes are both high and personal. F4 definitely feels like a spiritual companion to this summer’s Superman, which is similarly colorful and hope-filled. But I’d feel more comfortable taking my 3- and 6-year-old to F4 than Superman, which has a few moments that are a little too mature for younger kids."

      "reviewText": "I am admittedly not a DC comics guy. But Superman (1978) was one of the first movies I ever saw in the theater and it left a lasting impression on me. None of the Superman movies or shows since have come close to giving me that same sense of wonder. So my expectations going into James Gunn’s take were pretty low. And this is pretty much what I expected it to be. Lighter and more fun than the Snyder films, but overstuffed with characters and quips. There’s sooooo many characters here. From the room full of tech dweebs that work for Luthor to the staff of the Daily Planet, many of whom add little to the story outside of Lois (and Jimmy’s bizarre connection to Luthor). Corenswet strikes a great balance of earnestness and playfulness, and his chemistry with Brosnahan’s Lois worked well. But there was just so much other stuff going on. The nascent Justice League is shoehorned in to setup future DCU installments, only adding to the glut of characters. Not a bad movie by any stretch but it just felt like a missed opportunity to have a bigger take on what it means to be Superman in 2025, where having empathy is considered either “woke” or punk rock, depending on your perspective."

Gary Busey is woefully miscast as the lead henchman who dukes it out in a blurry mess of a hand-to-hand combat scene with Gibson in the climax. The plot is pretty incomprehensible, even by 80s standards. Some fun writing by Shane Black though not on the level of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or The Nice Guys. Overall kind of a disappointing rewatch."

      "reviewText": "First time watching this immediately after rewatching the HBO show, which unceremoniously ended after its third season. The lack of closure was really the only knock on this incredible series. This is less a movie than a proper send-off for nearly all the characters that last appeared 13 years earlier. And to boot we finally get to see the comeuppance of a cocksucking murderous land baron turned shitheel politician (in the parlance of the show), even if we may never see it play out in real life."

Dakota Johnson is so one-note, she comes across as terribly insincere in a job that requires a fair amount of empathy. But even in her romantic relationships, she gives off the same monotone vibe. Very Madame Web energy. Pedro is Pedro but largely wasted in a limited role. Chris Evans is fine but it's hard to sell him as a struggling actor. The movie also seems extremely cynical about marriage and relationships in general. A stark contrast with Past Lives, which had a lot more emotional weight than this follow-up from Celine Song."

The early digital holds up better than Bamboozled, though the few night scenes are grainy as hell, but it works. Completely forgot PSH is in this and his uncomfortable attraction to young Anna Paquin. \"what are you trying to be, R Kelly?\" Way ahead of its time.

There’s way less unlimited ammo pistol shots point blank to the face. Ballerina doesn’t reach the heights of John Wick 4, but Ana de Armas acquits herself well in an extremely physically demanding role and the action scenes are wildly creative and varied. There’s one sequence near the end that had me absolutely giddy. I’ve never seen anything like it. It was worth the price of admission alone. But the whole movie is pretty well-paced, aside from all the lore drops and whatnot. There’s just enough reference to Wick himself without overshadowing Ana’s protagonist. A fun time at the movies, for sure."

The supporting cast is filled with heavy hitters, and Katie Holmes. I can't believe this came out 20 years ago."

      "reviewText": "Only my second time watching this, the first since it was in the theater. I don't remember it leaving much of an impression on me and, watching it again, it still didn't. The movie looks great, shot entirely on digital, and unlike earlier digital films like Bamboozled, it still holds up. All of the performances are pretty one-note and there's not much drama. It feels like it's just checking off boxes of Dillinger's exploits. His relationship with Billie felt so underdeveloped that the ending just doesn't hit as hard as it should. Probably my least favorite Mann film, unfortunately."

John Heard chews up every scene as Alex Cutter, who's trying to help Bridges solve a murder he witnessed. Lisa Eichhorn gives a strong performance as Cutter's wife, Maureen. Bridges' character is named Richard Bone and he lives up to his name in this one, looking like an off-brand Robert Redford. Somehow at no point does anyone call him Dick. Not sure this fully clicked for me and the ending was very late 70s/early 80s. But I dug the three leads and their complicated relationship."

What a run he had in the 80s. Just about every movie of his from that time is deeply embedded in my brain. This movie demands a lega-sequel."

He's remarkably candid for someone who lived such a private life, even when the subject turns to his arrest and its devastating impact on his career. I'm happy that he got a second chance to share his gifts, and they truly were a gift, with the world. Paul passed away before the documentary was finished, and you get a sense that there's a tiny bit of his story that's unresolved. But what's there is touching and nostalgic and inspiring all at once and made me feel incredibly grateful that I was around at the height of Pee-Wee Herman and everything else Paul gave us after."

A ton of exposition up front in case you've never seen a Mission Impossible movie, followed by a whole lot of mechanations to acquire the MacGuffin. That said, the third act is absolutely thrilling. The plane sequence is up there with some of the best set pieces in the franchise and, unlike the much publicized motorcycle jump from the last movie, they left plenty of footage for the theater and the stunt actually makes sense in the context of the movie. Overall a fairly satisfying conclusion and some fun additions to the supporting cast. Also one of the most clever (and subtle) IMAX aspect ratio transitions I've ever seen."

I haven't seen this since becoming aware of Aaron Sorkin but watching it again it makes perfect sense that he's responsible for the cracking dialogue in this. A Few Good Men is probably best known for Nicholson's explosive testimony but you gotta appreciate his seething disdain for Cruise's smug, young lawyer from their first scene together. And also Demi's hair, which is impeccable. I hope Cruise goes back to lawyer roles when he gets tired of risking his life for the sake of \"mass entertainment.\""

Now, having seen all of Andor, there’s much more context and emotion behind the sacrifices made by the rebels to get the Death Star plans that leads to the opening of Episode IV. The effects here largely hold up, except for the CG humans, which didn’t look that great when this came out, and look even worse now. This remains one of the best Star Wars entries — a thrilling heist movie with a great cast. Hoping we get to see a Donnie Yen prequel series someday. It tickles me to think that Americans who only know Yen from this and John Wick 4 may think he’s actually blind. It also baffles me to think there are conservatives who watch Star Wars and somehow think they are like the rebels. Andor and Rogue One have become increasingly relevant as America and other parts of the world descend into fascism."

      "reviewText": "My expectations were low going in, given that Marvel's post-End Game offerings have been mostly meh. But good on Marvel for making an effort to give at least a few of the characters in Thunderbolts some depth. The backstories of the team members are left to the die hards who suffered through a half dozen mediocre TV shows and spinoff movies. There's some fun action and dialogue. The reveal of the villain and the resolution of their arc (and the movie itself) happens extremely late and way too quickly. I don't know if I'm on board with the implications of the movie's ending. Thunderbolts may have had an easier time at the box office if they just called it what it is."

      "reviewText": "On paper, a movie by the director of The Raid starring Tom Hardy sounds great but, sadly, the execution is lacking here. Outside of a couple fun set pieces, this is a pretty nondescript crime movie. Even the setting is some unknown, presumably American (based on the sheer number of guns) city, which looks like a combination of back lot sets and something made in Unreal Engine. This movie also has Timothy Olyphant, Forest Whitaker and Luis Guzman but pretty much squanders them. I really dug Apostle and Gangs of London, so I’m not sure what happened here but it’s not good."

But it’s a good hour or more into the movie before that happens. I’m not sure we needed two Michael B Jordans. The twins are so similar (very Winklevoss twins in Social Network) that if their costumes weren’t color-coded you’d be hard pressed to tell them apart. All that said, when this movie gets rolling it is fantastic. Borrows from great genre films but adds so much originality at the same time. An absolute showstopping musical number really wowed me. Great supporting cast, particularly Delroy Lindo (always a delight) and Miles Caton in his first feature role. Wow! Was glad I stuck around through the credits to see a cameo by a Chicago legend. Coogler is the real deal."

There’s entire seasons of Amazon’s Reacher that are better than this. The fight scenes are pretty poorly shot and choreographed, especially in a post-John Wick world. And if Cruise did his own stunts, you wouldn’t know it. But Cruise is still Cruise and never fails to win me over, even in dreck like this. Plus I’ve had a crush on Cobie Smulders since her How I Met Your Mother days. Overall, pretty inoffensive but doesn’t reach the highs of the first film and it’s hard not to think of Alan Ritchson as Reacher now."

Jack Black is in full Jack Black mode and shares a Point Break-esque homoerotic bond with a similarly over-the-top Jason Momoa.

I’d expect something at least a bit more entertaining from the director of Predator 2 and the writer of Point Break. The production looks like a bad network TV procedural, complete with overlays of the cast’s photos over the opening credits. If I had to guess I’d say that Jeffrey Epstein wrote this, or at least someone who had been to his island. Yeesh."

The logistics that must have gone into this to make it work are mind-boggling.

They tried to gaslight me into thinking this movie wasn’t called I Come in Peace when it was released in US theaters in 1990. I distinctly remember the ad where the alien villain says the name of the movie, “I come in peace,” to which Lundgren replies, “and you go in pieces” before blowing his ass up with his own space gun. But here it is, in glorious 4K all these years later and BOY, is this movie dumb. I love the subgenre of alien bad guy who has to be thwarted by a cop that doesn’t play by the rules (Predator 2, The Hidden). Bonus points if they team up with an alien cop (played here inexplicably by ESPN’s Jay Bilas, of all people). But this movie is just not good. I gave it two and a half stars out of pure nostalgia and because the human bad guys are a bunch of preppy white boys called, well, the White Boys, which seems pretty appropriate given the current state of affairs. Somehow Brian Benben went on to star in HBO’s Dream On, married Madeline Stowe and then basically fucked right off the planet Earth as far as I know but good for him!"

Every episode of this series takes that to heart, even if it's not immediately obvious why we're seeing that day. Truly one of the must watch series of the year."

An interesting concept, but one that is better realized in A Ghost Story, which I also didn't love but featured Rooney Mara eating a whole pie in one take. Nothing as daring on display here and a little too much exposition. But it was good to see Cleary from The Knick as a suburban dad."

It's hilarious to me that despite its sci-fi premise, nothing about this world aside from the concept of VR in the 1990s is particularly futuristic."

The cast is stacked with a who's who of famous actors, but like the Avengers movies, there's too many characters to give any meaningful time to develop. A lot of the action looks like stock footage, even though it's not. The movie gets more interesting in the last third as it focuses more on the plight of the soldiers on the ground and less on the logistics that the first third painfully drags out. It could have easily been an hour shorter and much improved if it just focused on the soldiers and didn't try to give equal screen time to all the higher-ups played by big name actors."

There's a sequence near the beginning where Li is battling the wife of a local merchant and must knock her to the ground to win the hand of their daughter that is just wildly outrageous. If that's not enough, Li's mom, played by Josephine Siao, takes a turn, posing as Li's older brother. Delightful. The 4k transfer looks great."

Went in looking to fill some gaps in my Gene Hackman watches and was disappointed to get way more Costner. Hackman is good here, playing sleazy and desperate in equal measure but he just doesn't get enough screen time. Instead, Costner, who I've always felt is less an actor than a \"movie star\" runs around the Pentagon like a maniac for half the movie. Was hoping Hackman would be more adversarial but after the \"incident\" he's largely out of play until the end. Will Patton seems like he's in a completely different movie than everyone else but is maybe the best part."

As someone who dreamed of being on SNL practically since birth, I found a lot to love here. It's like the comedy version of The Last Dance but with less of a cohesive through line between episodes."

Having watched Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore about a hundred times in college, I was pleasantly surprised by Sandler's dramatic turn back then. In the years since he's gotten worse at comedy and better at drama, even if he seldom does serious roles. I love the low-budget feel of this, Emily Watson's tender performance, and PSH, my god. To think of all the brilliant performances we've missed out on since his passing. Tragic. He's the perfect foil to Sandler's Barry Egan."

A modern-ish noir with lots of twists and turns and plot points that fall apart if you think about them for more than half a second. It's like a Lifetime movie made for Cinemax, with Denise Richards providing lots of male gaze bits. It's not a good movie by any means but it's pretty fun and trashy all the way through to the credits, where a bunch of stuff is revealed that happened off-camera."

Yet this story, about the real-life Rehabilitation Through the Arts program at Sing Sing, proves that wrong, blending fact with fiction with a cast of real RTA alums. Coleman Domingo gives a powerful performance and deserves all of the awards buzz. But the real standout for me was Clarence Maclin, one of the RTA members, who plays his vital arc with convincing nuance. A great pairing with Ghostlight, which also shows the redemptive power of theater."

Framed by a Q&A many years after the war, Gunnar tells the audience of young Norwegians, “All these stories that you see that are published in the papers, they tell them. It’s the owners. What to print and what not to print. Every single time. So in the case of war, well, those papers should be lit instead. They’re mere kindling.” That really stuck with me given the current state of things. The flashbacks to the war are pretty standard fare, but Gunnar’s reckoning with his actions after being questioned by a young woman at the Q&A was quite poignant. Worth watching."

It asks us to take action before it’s too late but has no ideas about what those actions might be.

      "reviewText": "Kyle Mooney's humor is definitely not for everyone but this movie had me laughing my ass off. Heavy on the late 90s nostalgia and includes maybe the best cameo of the year. Brilliantly spoofs movies of that era and mixes genres in a fun way. It's almost a millennial Wet Hot American Summer. Didn't love this as much as Brigsby Bear but was not disappointed."

The whole thing didn't add up to much, mostly because there's just not enough time to develop its characters. There's definitely some Heat and Sicario influences at play but The Order lacks the depth of those films. Might have been better as the next season of True Detective."

This doc mostly covers his life after being paralyzed, his advocacy for the disabled, and the family, friends, and legacy he left behind. It had me in tears for most of the last 20 minutes. It's devastating to see our heroes fall but some manage to rise up and be more heroic than ever. Reeve was certainly one of those heroes."

The score is both chilling and whimsical at times, and the cast features some great supporting actors, including Danny Huston, who plays Kidman’s (adult) fiancée. Watching him unravel as Kidman gets pulled deeper into this kid’s story culminates in such a delightful way. I really had no idea where this was going until the very end."

I was expecting it to lean a bit more into its initial premise but it keeps it at arms length. Aubrey Plaza and Maisy Stella couldn’t be more different but they make it work. And I randomly watched back-to-back movies with Percy Hynes White, who is charming and down-to-earth here. I was ready to write this off as just another breezy rom-com but the ending really landed for me and reminded me of one of my favorite movies that I won’t name because that would spoil this one."

      "reviewText": "Despite finding nearly every character in this movie unlikable and entitled, I was captivated the whole time. I would describe Anora as Pretty Woman meets Uncut Gems. Mikey Madison gives a really brave performance. Sean Baker again shows he’s a unique and incredibly talented filmmaker. I was surprised how funny this movie was. Also, it’s clear the actor that plays Vanya never played a video game in his life."

      "reviewText": "A really sweet and earnest coming-of-age movie. I also like movies and grew up in the video store age, so I found a lot to relate to. Isaiah Lehtinen is really great and believably awkward as the lead character, Lawrence. I almost wish the movie was longer than its 100 minute run time. I would have liked to see more of Lawrence and his manager Alana’s relationship develop. It seemed a little rushed."

      "reviewText": "This movie is painfully long but I have to give it props for its sheer ambition and scope. Kirk Douglas is such a charmer you can believe he’d be able to lead a slave uprising. Given recent events I was all jazzed when the slaves were eating the rich but uh, well, I guess we’re all truly fucked."
