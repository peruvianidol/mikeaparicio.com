      "reviewText": "Looking back, Nolan's first foray into superhero movies is a little shaggy. So much happens in the first third, setting up a finale that doesn't quite pay off. The hand-to-hand combat is shot soooo close up and with so many edits that it's practically incomprehensible. Still, I love this version of Batman, and Bale has a great mix of physicality and humor. The supporting cast is filled with heavy hitters, and Katie Holmes. I can't believe this came out 20 years ago."

      "reviewText": "Only my second time watching this, the first since it was in the theater. I don't remember it leaving much of an impression on me and, watching it again, it still didn't. The movie looks great, shot entirely on digital, and unlike earlier digital films like Bamboozled, it still holds up. All of the performances are pretty one-note and there's not much drama. It feels like it's just checking off boxes of Dillinger's exploits. His relationship with Billie felt so underdeveloped that the ending just doesn't hit as hard as it should. Probably my least favorite Mann film, unfortunately."

Some stuff happens in this movie but you never care because it's all boring CG and the same choreography you've seen in every Marvel movie. This entry has absolutely nothing to say, which is a shame because there's so much potential having a black Captain America in 2025. The best part was when the credits finally rolled and I could get on with my life."

      "reviewText": "Checking out a Jeff Bridges deep cut I hadn't seen. What an odd movie. All the trappings of a neo-noir but at its center are three fucked up friends. John Heard chews up every scene as Alex Cutter, who's trying to help Bridges solve a murder he witnessed. Lisa Eichhorn gives a strong performance as Cutter's wife, Maureen. Bridges' character is named Richard Bone and he lives up to his name in this one, looking like an off-brand Robert Redford. Somehow at no point does anyone call him Dick. Not sure this fully clicked for me and the ending was very late 70s/early 80s. But I dug the three leads and their complicated relationship."

      "reviewText": "I loved this movie as a kid, though I probably couldn't tell you why. As an adult, the idea of experiencing grief over the loss of a loved one and then getting a second chance with them, in a sense, really hits different. I love Karen Allen's performance, and this might be my second favorite Jeff Bridges movie. I'd probably seen this a dozen times and only realized recently that it was a John Carpenter movie. What a run he had in the 80s. Just about every movie of his from that time is deeply embedded in my brain. This movie demands a lega-sequel."

      "reviewText": "Paul Reubens is so charming and dryly funny in this doc about his life. I was predisposed to loving this, as Pee-Wee was a big part of my childhood and likely had a big influence on my sense of humor. He's remarkably candid for someone who lived such a private life, even when the subject turns to his arrest and its devastating impact on his career. I'm happy that he got a second chance to share his gifts, and they truly were a gift, with the world. Paul passed away before the documentary was finished, and you get a sense that there's a tiny bit of his story that's unresolved. But what's there is touching and nostalgic and inspiring all at once and made me feel incredibly grateful that I was around at the height of Pee-Wee Herman and everything else Paul gave us after."

      "reviewText": "I really loved Dead Reckoning so I was disappointed to find most of its conclusion to be contrived and overstuffed. A ton of exposition up front in case you've never seen a Mission Impossible movie, followed by a whole lot of mechanations to acquire the MacGuffin. That said, the third act is absolutely thrilling. The plane sequence is up there with some of the best set pieces in the franchise and, unlike the much publicized motorcycle jump from the last movie, they left plenty of footage for the theater and the stunt actually makes sense in the context of the movie. Overall a fairly satisfying conclusion and some fun additions to the supporting cast. Also one of the most clever (and subtle) IMAX aspect ratio transitions I've ever seen."

      "reviewText": "A quaint throwback to a time when government officials could be held accountable for their actions. I haven't seen this since becoming aware of Aaron Sorkin but watching it again it makes perfect sense that he's responsible for the cracking dialogue in this. A Few Good Men is probably best known for Nicholson's explosive testimony but you gotta appreciate his seething disdain for Cruise's smug, young lawyer from their first scene together. And also Demi's hair, which is impeccable. I hope Cruise goes back to lawyer roles when he gets tired of risking his life for the sake of \"mass entertainment.\""

      "reviewText": "Had to revisit this after wrapping up Andor S2, which I found to be a bit uneven but did a great job of setting the stage for Rogue One. Now, having seen all of Andor, there’s much more context and emotion behind the sacrifices made by the rebels to get the Death Star plans that leads to the opening of Episode IV. The effects here largely hold up, except for the CG humans, which didn’t look that great when this came out, and look even worse now. This remains one of the best Star Wars entries — a thrilling heist movie with a great cast. Hoping we get to see a Donnie Yen prequel series someday. It tickles me to think that Americans who only know Yen from this and John Wick 4 may think he’s actually blind. It also baffles me to think there are conservatives who watch Star Wars and somehow think they are like the rebels. Andor and Rogue One have become increasingly relevant as America and other parts of the world descend into fascism."

I love Star Trek and I get what they were going for here but it didn’t quite work for me. Tim Allen is woefully miscast and Alan Rickman probably didn’t have to stretch too far to play a Shakespearean actor playing a role that’s beneath him. I loved Sam Rockwell’s manic energy and whatever the hell Enrico Colantoni is doing."

      "reviewText": "My expectations were low going in, given that Marvel's post-End Game offerings have been mostly meh. But good on Marvel for making an effort to give at least a few of the characters in Thunderbolts some depth. The backstories of the team members are left to the die hards who suffered through a half dozen mediocre TV shows and spinoff movies. There's some fun action and dialogue. The reveal of the villain and the resolution of their arc (and the movie itself) happens extremely late and way too quickly. I don't know if I'm on board with the implications of the movie's ending. Thunderbolts may have had an easier time at the box office if they just called it what it is."

      "reviewText": "On paper, a movie by the director of The Raid starring Tom Hardy sounds great but, sadly, the execution is lacking here. Outside of a couple fun set pieces, this is a pretty nondescript crime movie. Even the setting is some unknown, presumably American (based on the sheer number of guns) city, which looks like a combination of back lot sets and something made in Unreal Engine. This movie also has Timothy Olyphant, Forest Whitaker and Luis Guzman but pretty much squanders them. I really dug Apostle and Gangs of London, so I’m not sure what happened here but it’s not good."

There’s entire seasons of Amazon’s Reacher that are better than this. The fight scenes are pretty poorly shot and choreographed, especially in a post-John Wick world. And if Cruise did his own stunts, you wouldn’t know it. But Cruise is still Cruise and never fails to win me over, even in dreck like this. Plus I’ve had a crush on Cobie Smulders since her How I Met Your Mother days. Overall, pretty inoffensive but doesn’t reach the highs of the first film and it’s hard not to think of Alan Ritchson as Reacher now."

Jack Black is in full Jack Black mode and shares a Point Break-esque homoerotic bond with a similarly over-the-top Jason Momoa.

And Mauricio Lombardi is delightful as Inspector Ravini, who always seems to be both a step ahead and a step behind Ripley at every moment. The pacing may seem slow as the series likes to luxuriate in every detail, but I loved every minute of it."

I’d expect something at least a bit more entertaining from the director of Predator 2 and the writer of Point Break. The production looks like a bad network TV procedural, complete with overlays of the cast’s photos over the opening credits. If I had to guess I’d say that Jeffrey Epstein wrote this, or at least someone who had been to his island. Yeesh."

The logistics that must have gone into this to make it work are mind-boggling.

They tried to gaslight me into thinking this movie wasn’t called I Come in Peace when it was released in US theaters in 1990. I distinctly remember the ad where the alien villain says the name of the movie, “I come in peace,” to which Lundgren replies, “and you go in pieces” before blowing his ass up with his own space gun. But here it is, in glorious 4K all these years later and BOY, is this movie dumb. I love the subgenre of alien bad guy who has to be thwarted by a cop that doesn’t play by the rules (Predator 2, The Hidden). Bonus points if they team up with an alien cop (played here inexplicably by ESPN’s Jay Bilas, of all people). But this movie is just not good. I gave it two and a half stars out of pure nostalgia and because the human bad guys are a bunch of preppy white boys called, well, the White Boys, which seems pretty appropriate given the current state of affairs. Somehow Brian Benben went on to star in HBO’s Dream On, married Madeline Stowe and then basically fucked right off the planet Earth as far as I know but good for him!"

I'm not sure each episode needed to be shot in one take but it's done masterfully here. If there are any sneaky edits they're extremely hard time spot, which makes the performances, particularly Stephen Graham and Owen Cooper's, that much more mesmerizing. At Second City they teach you \"today is the day,\" that every good story is the day something happens that changes its characters. Every episode of this series takes that to heart, even if it's not immediately obvious why we're seeing that day. Truly one of the must watch series of the year."

An interesting concept, but one that is better realized in A Ghost Story, which I also didn't love but featured Rooney Mara eating a whole pie in one take. Nothing as daring on display here and a little too much exposition. But it was good to see Cleary from The Knick as a suburban dad."

The cast is stacked with a who's who of famous actors, but like the Avengers movies, there's too many characters to give any meaningful time to develop. A lot of the action looks like stock footage, even though it's not. The movie gets more interesting in the last third as it focuses more on the plight of the soldiers on the ground and less on the logistics that the first third painfully drags out. It could have easily been an hour shorter and much improved if it just focused on the soldiers and didn't try to give equal screen time to all the higher-ups played by big name actors."

There's a sequence near the beginning where Li is battling the wife of a local merchant and must knock her to the ground to win the hand of their daughter that is just wildly outrageous. If that's not enough, Li's mom, played by Josephine Siao, takes a turn, posing as Li's older brother. Delightful. The 4k transfer looks great."

Went in looking to fill some gaps in my Gene Hackman watches and was disappointed to get way more Costner. Hackman is good here, playing sleazy and desperate in equal measure but he just doesn't get enough screen time. Instead, Costner, who I've always felt is less an actor than a \"movie star\" runs around the Pentagon like a maniac for half the movie. Was hoping Hackman would be more adversarial but after the \"incident\" he's largely out of play until the end. Will Patton seems like he's in a completely different movie than everyone else but is maybe the best part."

I had heard almost universally that the first half was a masterpiece and the end was disappointing but it seems like they oversold the former and undersold the latter. Beautiful looking film and a good performance by Brody, but best picture? Meh."

Having watched Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore about a hundred times in college, I was pleasantly surprised by Sandler's dramatic turn back then. In the years since he's gotten worse at comedy and better at drama, even if he seldom does serious roles. I love the low-budget feel of this, Emily Watson's tender performance, and PSH, my god. To think of all the brilliant performances we've missed out on since his passing. Tragic. He's the perfect foil to Sandler's Barry Egan."

A modern-ish noir with lots of twists and turns and plot points that fall apart if you think about them for more than half a second. It's like a Lifetime movie made for Cinemax, with Denise Richards providing lots of male gaze bits. It's not a good movie by any means but it's pretty fun and trashy all the way through to the credits, where a bunch of stuff is revealed that happened off-camera."

Yet this story, about the real-life Rehabilitation Through the Arts program at Sing Sing, proves that wrong, blending fact with fiction with a cast of real RTA alums. Coleman Domingo gives a powerful performance and deserves all of the awards buzz. But the real standout for me was Clarence Maclin, one of the RTA members, who plays his vital arc with convincing nuance. A great pairing with Ghostlight, which also shows the redemptive power of theater."

Framed by a Q&A many years after the war, Gunnar tells the audience of young Norwegians, “All these stories that you see that are published in the papers, they tell them. It’s the owners. What to print and what not to print. Every single time. So in the case of war, well, those papers should be lit instead. They’re mere kindling.” That really stuck with me given the current state of things. The flashbacks to the war are pretty standard fare, but Gunnar’s reckoning with his actions after being questioned by a young woman at the Q&A was quite poignant. Worth watching."

It asks us to take action before it’s too late but has no ideas about what those actions might be.

This doc mostly covers his life after being paralyzed, his advocacy for the disabled, and the family, friends, and legacy he left behind. It had me in tears for most of the last 20 minutes. It's devastating to see our heroes fall but some manage to rise up and be more heroic than ever. Reeve was certainly one of those heroes."

Watching him unravel as Kidman gets pulled deeper into this kid’s story culminates in such a delightful way. I really had no idea where this was going until the very end."

      "reviewText": "A short and sweet coming-of-age movie with a dash of magic(?), for lack of a better word. I was expecting it to lean a bit more into its initial premise but it keeps it at arms length. Aubrey Plaza and Maisy Stella couldn’t be more different but they make it work. And I randomly watched back-to-back movies with Percy Hynes White, who is charming and down-to-earth here. I was ready to write this off as just another breezy rom-com but the ending really landed for me and reminded me of one of my favorite movies that I won’t name because that would spoil this one."

      "reviewText": "Despite finding nearly every character in this movie unlikable and entitled, I was captivated the whole time. I would describe Anora as Pretty Woman meets Uncut Gems. Mikey Madison gives a really brave performance. Sean Baker again shows he’s a unique and incredibly talented filmmaker. I was surprised how funny this movie was. Also, it’s clear the actor that plays Vanya never played a video game in his life."

      "reviewText": "A really sweet and earnest coming-of-age movie. I also like movies and grew up in the video store age, so I found a lot to relate to. Isaiah Lehtinen is really great and believably awkward as the lead character, Lawrence. I almost wish the movie was longer than its 100 minute run time. I would have liked to see more of Lawrence and his manager Alana’s relationship develop. It seemed a little rushed."

      "reviewText": "This movie is painfully long but I have to give it props for its sheer ambition and scope. Kirk Douglas is such a charmer you can believe he’d be able to lead a slave uprising. Given recent events I was all jazzed when the slaves were eating the rich but uh, well, I guess we’re all truly fucked."
