There's scenes where I'm just like, \"how did they film this without anyone dying?\" That's when you know you're watching greatness. Being a dad definitely gave me a different perspective, particularly around the young crew members. Why did we get like 30 MCU movies but just one of these?"

He commits a murder early in the movie and then there's a whole half hour of him at the police station and despite there being a ton of witnesses, no one is like \"yeah, it was that Inspector Gadget-looking motherfucker right there.\" A tan trenchcoat and fedora is like the most sus, cliched outfit ever. Anyway, I couldn't stop thinking about it and it kept me from fully enjoying this movie."

Beautiful looking film and a good performance by Brody, but best picture? Meh."

      "reviewText": "Bought the 4k Criterion of this even though I hadn't seen it since it came out and only remember being disappointed with PTA's follow-up to Boogie Nights and Magnolia. 20+ years later he's made some more great movies (There Will Be Blood, Phantom Thread) and some stinkers (Inherent Vice, Licorice Pizza) putting this somewhere in the middle for me. Having watched Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore about a hundred times in college, I was pleasantly surprised by Sandler's dramatic turn back then. In the years since he's gotten worse at comedy and better at drama, even if he seldom does serious roles. I love the low-budget feel of this, Emily Watson's tender performance, and PSH, my god. To think of all the brilliant performances we've missed out on since his passing. Tragic. He's the perfect foil to Sandler's Barry Egan."

      "reviewText": "An extremely dumb B-movie that somehow lucked out in convincing Denzel to lead it and finding a young Russell Crowe to play its over-the-top VR villain come to life. The writing is awful but you can still see Crowe is a star in the making, and Denzel just naturally elevates everything he's in. It's hilarious to me that despite its sci-fi premise, nothing about this world aside from the concept of VR in the 1990s is particularly futuristic."

      "reviewText": "Like the operation this WW2 movie depicts, A Bridge Too Far is overly-ambitious and doesn't quite succeed. The cast is stacked with a who's who of famous actors, but like the Avengers movies, there's too many characters to give any meaningful time to develop. A lot of the action looks like stock footage, even though it's not. The movie gets more interesting in the last third as it focuses more on the plight of the soldiers on the ground and less on the logistics that the first third painfully drags out. It could have easily been an hour shorter and much improved if it just focused on the soldiers and didn't try to give equal screen time to all the higher-ups played by big name actors."

      "reviewText": "Probably the funniest movie Jet Li has made. In most of his movies he plays a very serious martial artist, but here he's letting loose and having fun. Some incredibly inventive wire work and choreography and a few laugh out loud props that had me screaming. There's a sequence near the beginning where Li is battling the wife of a local merchant and must knock her to the ground to win the hand of their daughter that is just wildly outrageous. If that's not enough, Li's mom, played by Josephine Siao, takes a turn, posing as Li's older brother. Delightful. The 4k transfer looks great."

      "reviewText": "The Hackman marathon continues. I didn't quite care for this 70s noir where Hackman's detective, Harry Mosby, isn't particularly good at his job, or maybe it's just that the central \"mystery\" just isn't that compelling. The real mystery doesn't become evident until nearly the end and even then it feels like a lot is left unsolved, including Harry's own personal life. Man, people sure were horny in the 70s. It seems that everyone in this movie is looking to score, including a young Melanie Griffith. (I didn't even realize it was her until the credits rolled.) Hackman was good though. Just about the only thing keeping me from falling asleep."

      "reviewText": "This movie is a prime example of how a twist ending doesn't make a bad/average movie better in retrospect. No Way Out is a decent thriller but the ending is so nonsensical. Went in looking to fill some gaps in my Gene Hackman watches and was disappointed to get way more Costner. Hackman is good here, playing sleazy and desperate in equal measure but he just doesn't get enough screen time. Instead, Costner, who I've always felt is less an actor than a \"movie star\" runs around the Pentagon like a maniac for half the movie. Was hoping Hackman would be more adversarial but after the \"incident\" he's largely out of play until the end. Will Patton seems like he's in a completely different movie than everyone else but is maybe the best part."

There's a ton of kinetic, hard-hitting fight scenes in this, including a prolonged fight with an imposing final boss-type at the end. There are some painful lulls in between but the fights are so well-choreographed and filmed, compared to anything I'd ever seen before in the 90s. This 4k blu-ray looks great but the sound is unfortunately mono. Looking forward to filling out my 4k collection with more Jet Li films, including Tai Chi Master and Fong Sai Yuk."

It's not a top tier 90s action movie but it's incredibly watchable, largely thanks to Wesley Snipes' charisma and action chops and Sandra Bullock going all-in as Stallone's hopelessly optimistic and 20th century-loving partner. There are some fun action set pieces, including one of the most memorable demises of a villain. How this got made I have no idea but I wish they still made stuff like this."

      "reviewText": "I feel like maybe I saw this before but it was so forgettable that nothing stuck. I definitely remember the poster. Anyway, this movie is very 90s in just about every way. A modern-ish noir with lots of twists and turns and plot points that fall apart if you think about them for more than half a second. It's like a Lifetime movie made for Cinemax, with Denise Richards providing lots of male gaze bits. It's not a good movie by any means but it's pretty fun and trashy all the way through to the credits, where a bunch of stuff is revealed that happened off-camera."

      "reviewText": "This was more fun than I was expecting. Dog Man is the hero but it's really Pete Davidson's movie. There was a lot to relate to in being a parent and dog owner. At one point Petey asks L'il Petey, \"how come I made you but you're not like me?\" To which L'il Petey responds, \"maybe I am but you just don't like that part.\" That gutted me. Some great humor and 80s references for parents and came in at under 90 minutes."

      "reviewText": "There‚Äôs a vulnerability in acting that almost seems incongruous with prison life. Yet this story, about the real-life Rehabilitation Through the Arts program at Sing Sing, proves that wrong, blending fact with fiction with a cast of real RTA alums. Coleman Domingo gives a powerful performance and deserves all of the awards buzz. But the real standout for me was Clarence Maclin, one of the RTA members, who plays his vital arc with convincing nuance. A great pairing with Ghostlight, which also shows the redemptive power of theater."

Framed by a Q&A many years after the war, Gunnar tells the audience of young Norwegians, ‚ÄúAll these stories that you see that are published in the papers, they tell them. It‚Äôs the owners. What to print and what not to print. Every single time. So in the case of war, well, those papers should be lit instead. They‚Äôre mere kindling.‚Äù That really stuck with me given the current state of things. The flashbacks to the war are pretty standard fare, but Gunnar‚Äôs reckoning with his actions after being questioned by a young woman at the Q&A was quite poignant. Worth watching."
