    "reviewText": "Wow, that was deeply unsettling. Blink Twice sets the table and then just kinda of lets you stew in a sense of unease before finally revealing itself. From there it gets wild. I never thought much of Channing Tatum as an actor but he’s perfectly cast here, delivering a mix of charm and menace. The ending is *chef’s kiss*."

    "reviewText": "There’s a lot to love here, particularly Daniel Day-Lewis’ performance as Bill the Butcher. It feels like both DiCaprio and Diaz are miscast and Scorsese just tries to do too much at the end. There’s a lot of build-up to a climactic confrontation that’s largely disrupted by a historical event. This movie is probably more relevant to today’s political climate than it was in 2002. If only we could see we should be fighting the “$300 men” instead of each other."

    "reviewText": "This “documentary” is like “Somebody Should Do Something About All the Problems” framed in a vague speculative fiction dystopia. It lists off problems that, to no one’s surprise, are bad! And if left unchecked, could lead to a disastrous future, as if it’s not already here. It asks us to take action before it’s too late but has no ideas about what those actions might be. One of the many problems it covers is AI, but it seems like AI was used to make the doc? 84 minutes of my life I’ll never get back."

I don't know that I ever saw him in anything else until after he passed. He was just always Superman. This doc mostly covers his life after being paralyzed, his advocacy for the disabled, and the family, friends, and legacy he left behind. It had me in tears for most of the last 20 minutes. It's devastating to see our heroes fall but some manage to rise up and be more heroic than ever. Reeve was certainly one of those heroes."

It’s truly a miracle that no one died making this movie, particularly Michelle Yeoh, who is absolutely fearless and very much Jackie’s equal in terms of skill and screen presence. The plot is ridiculously over-the-top but grounded with humor, like many of Jackie’s movies. Props to the stunt team who managed several set pieces on par with modern Mission: Impossible movies years earlier. There are very few movie stars that would risk their lives just to entertain us for a couple of hours but I’m glad they exist."

Paul Mescal takes up the mantle for Russell Crowe’s Maximus, whose presence looms large over the movie, and does a serviceable job. Denzel Washington is just having a blast here. He’s bringing Training Day energy, which would otherwise seem out of place if it weren’t for the comically over-the-top twin emperors of Rome. The set pieces are solid and the whole affair leads up to a rousing and satisfying conclusion. Love that Ridley Scott is still banging out movies, even if they don’t all hit as hard as this one."

    "reviewText": "The setup of this movie is so brilliantly economical. Seeing this in the theater before Arnold became a superstar and Terminator 2 became a pop culture phenomenon, the night club scene must have been wild. The shootout at the police station must have seemed utterly terrifying but today it’s just a Tuesday. The effects don’t hold up very well, particularly in the otherwise gorgeous 4K transfer, but this is such a well-crafted film and a template for Cameron’s later work that would go on to shatter box office records again and again."

    "reviewText": "I was interested in checking out this early work of Jonathan Glazer and it did not disappoint. From the very beginning, like Nicole Kidman, you’re not fully convinced whether 10-year-old Cameron Bright is actually the reincarnation of her dead husband. The score is both chilling and whimsical at times, and the cast features some great supporting actors, including Danny Huston, who plays Kidman’s (adult) fiancée. Watching him unravel as Kidman gets pulled deeper into this kid’s story culminates in such a delightful way. I really had no idea where this was going until the very end."

    "reviewText": "A short and sweet coming-of-age movie with a dash of magic(?), for lack of a better word.

And I randomly watched back-to-back movies with Percy Hynes White, who is charming and down-to-earth here. I was ready to write this off as just another breezy rom-com but the ending really landed for me and reminded me of one of my favorite movies that I won’t name because that would spoil this one."

Coralie Fargeat’s follow-up to 2017’s excellent Revenge is so confident and well-executed. It “yes ands” itself to absurd heights (depths?) in a way that elicited such joy that I couldn’t help wish I had seen this opening night in a packed screening. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley are excellent. Fargeat asks a lot from them and they deliver. I don’t know that I can recommend this to literally anyone but for me, it was perfect."

    "reviewText": "I was predisposed to liking this, having grown up with SNL (we both turn 50 in 2025) . This is an earnest and loving imagining(?) of the 90 minutes leading up to the first episode. I’m sure very little of this happened that night and characterizations of real life people are far from accurate, but like the show Winning Time, I couldn’t care less because the subject matter is something I enjoy and have deep knowledge about. Love the casting — the SNL regulars were largely unknown to me but each do a passable job of capturing the essence of their real life counterparts. The more known actors around them are inspired casting. I wish the movie had spent more time fleshing out the main SNL cast, it gives particularly short shrift to the female cast members, spending most of its runtime following Lorne Michaels. It’s still quite enjoyable, though probably less so if you’re not familiar with SNL lore, particularly those early years. I can imagine this being nearly unintelligible without that context. When they finally say the iconic opening line, I got a little choked up."
