      "reviewText": "Around the time this came out on cable I used to watch it all the time. It‚Äôs a goofy premise (which I only now learned was written by David Mamet, of all people) but DeNiro and Penn really sell it. DeNiro with his entire range of facial expressions and Penn with his earnestness. There‚Äôs also a spunky young Demi Moore, John C Reilly doing his thing, and Wallace Shawn. It‚Äôs almost cartoonishly silly, but it still tickled me all these years later."

      "reviewText": "I remember seeing this on opening night in a sold out theater, an impressionable 18-year-old, barely a month into my freshman year in college. I had never seen anything like it. Years later it‚Äôs obvious the movies that influenced it, but to mention them here would spoil the surprises. Suffice it to say, this movie still slaps. I love it unapologetically. The central cast is great, including an all-time monologue from Alec Baldwin about his ‚Äúgod complex.‚Äù Lots of great supporting actors pop up, including Anne Bancroft and a 21-year-old Gwenyth Paltrow. Also, I was shocked to learn it was co-written by Aaron Sorkin! When the final twist was revealed, I cackled out loud and it brought me back to that packed college theater where everyone was hooting and hollering."

      "reviewText": "Incredible body horror classic. Hadn‚Äôt seen it in ages. I forgot how utterly disturbing the last 10 minutes were. Goldblum is perfectly cast as a twitchy nerd fused with a fly, his subtle mannerisms getting more fly-like throughout. For a relatively short movie, it drags at times, particularly all of the 80s obsession dudes had with getting laid. Still, the practical effects are still pretty amazing. A remake these days would probably be all CG and lose all of the magic."

      "reviewText": "Had I seen this version first I may have enjoyed the 2024 version a bit less. This version is considerably more streamlined and has a very Hollywood ending. However, I loved the relationship between Dantes and Luis Guzman‚Äôs Jacopo, who is present in the 2024 version but has no lines and the nature of their relationship is never mentioned. I also loved Richard Harris as Abb√© Faria, much more playful in this version. Guy Pierce really chews up the scenery as the main target of Dante‚Äôs‚Äô vengeance, while the other two are relegated to almost footnotes. Also 18-year-old Henry Cavill! This version is great in its own right. I‚Äôd say if you like this version and haven‚Äôt seen the 2024 one, they‚Äôre quite different in style and execution, you might enjoy it as well though."

      "reviewText": "This movie surprised me at every turn. It starts as almost a stage play before turning into a full-on police procedural. It goes places both literally and figuratively that I wasn‚Äôt expecting. There are some extraordinary touches like a dash of color in an otherwise black and white movie, and the eerie reflection in the kidnapper‚Äôs sunglasses. The ending fell a little flat for me. I guess I‚Äôve been conditioned by modern movies to expect big twist. It felt very Japanese. I can see why Spike‚Äôs remake is getting such tepid reviews. The bar is set pretty high here."

      "reviewText": "This sequel looks gorgeous but maybe a little too pristine. Part of the charm of the first Tron was that the effects were scrappy. The change makes sense thematically but is undercut by the jarring uncanny valley of Clu, a digitized and de-aged Jeff Bridges. They should have leaned more into the imperfection. The plot is pretty nonsensical, not that the first one was incredible either. Bridges seems like he‚Äôs in full Lebowski mode here minus the laughs. The music and the aesthetic really carry this, but also show the beginnings of a style that Kosinski would go on to hone in Oblivion, Top Gun: Maverick, and F1."

On paper, a Ridley Scott film written by Cormac McCarthy and starring this A-List cast seems like a sure fire hit. But what we get instead is a bunch of memorable scenes intercut with lots of talk about sex, and not in an interesting way. Half of the characters are like something out of a GTA game and the dialogue is so heavy-handed it doesn‚Äôt make sense coming out of these characters, even when it‚Äôs delivered by great actors. The whole thing adds up to very little because it seems the characters fall victim to their own actions which are only alluded to during the course of the movie, and their fates don‚Äôt really feel justified based on the plot of the movie.

Feels like a mashup of some of his previous work. The first hour is dreadfully dull but once the juice is loose, so to speak, things get interesting with some fun body horror and practical effects. This movie could explain why evangelicals are so opposed to higher education."

      "reviewText": "There‚Äôs no reason for this sequel to exist besides the fact that Netflix dropped a boatload of money on Sandler. Despite that, this movie is a ton of fun. The plot is even thinner than the first but the sheer amount of jokes and cameos keep things interesting. Nearly all of the characters from 30 years ago make an appearance in some way (even the dead ones) and nearly all of them have offspring perfect for stunt casting. If, like me, you watched the original a bunch of times on VHS or cable TV in college, you‚Äôll get a kick out of this."

      "reviewText": "Near the end of Mississippi Burning, Willem Dafoe‚Äôs FBI Agent Ward says, ‚ÄúAnyone‚Äôs guilty who watches this happen and pretends it isn‚Äôt.‚Äù As tough as the movie is to watch, some degree of justice is served at the end. But sadly enough, the guilty are now in the highest offices, inflicting greater wounds on larger swaths of people that aren‚Äôt like them. This was made some thirty years after the events depicted and now, 60 years on we haven‚Äôt done much better. This might be up there for Hackman‚Äôs greatest roles. The antithesis of his character in Unforgiven. Dafoe is also great as his partner, and there‚Äôs a slew of ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù to be found on both sides of the law. This movie is near perfect if only it had given its black characters as much depth and dialogue as it does its white characters. It‚Äôs left up to a bunch of white FBI agents to save the day which, in retrospect, seems highly implausible."

This is the first Marvel movie in forever where it didn‚Äôt feel like you needed to do homework to follow the story, and they weren‚Äôt adding a bunch of storylines to set up the next thing. There‚Äôs no glowing MacGuffin and the stakes are both high and personal. F4 definitely feels like a spiritual companion to this summer‚Äôs Superman, which is similarly colorful and hope-filled. But I‚Äôd feel more comfortable taking my 3- and 6-year-old to F4 than Superman, which has a few moments that are a little too mature for younger kids."

None of the Superman movies or shows since have come close to giving me that same sense of wonder. So my expectations going into James Gunn‚Äôs take were pretty low. And this is pretty much what I expected it to be. Lighter and more fun than the Snyder films, but overstuffed with characters and quips. There‚Äôs sooooo many characters here. From the room full of tech dweebs that work for Luthor to the staff of the Daily Planet, many of whom add little to the story outside of Lois (and Jimmy‚Äôs bizarre connection to Luthor). Corenswet strikes a great balance of earnestness and playfulness, and his chemistry with Brosnahan‚Äôs Lois worked well. But there was just so much other stuff going on. The nascent Justice League is shoehorned in to setup future DCU installments, only adding to the glut of characters. Not a bad movie by any stretch but it just felt like a missed opportunity to have a bigger take on what it means to be Superman in 2025, where having empathy is considered either ‚Äúwoke‚Äù or punk rock, depending on your perspective."

Gary Busey is woefully miscast as the lead henchman who dukes it out in a blurry mess of a hand-to-hand combat scene with Gibson in the climax.

The performances feel a little too heightened, particularly Bridget Fonda, who becomes increasingly unhinged and diabolical as the movie goes on. Great ensemble cast though. Loved Chelcie Ross as the sheriff and Gary Cole as the mysterious and slightly menacing FBI agent."

The lack of closure was really the only knock on this incredible series. This is less a movie than a proper send-off for nearly all the characters that last appeared 13 years earlier. And to boot we finally get to see the comeuppance of a cocksucking murderous land baron turned shitheel politician (in the parlance of the show), even if we may never see it play out in real life."

Dakota Johnson is so one-note, she comes across as terribly insincere in a job that requires a fair amount of empathy. But even in her romantic relationships, she gives off the same monotone vibe. Very Madame Web energy. Pedro is Pedro but largely wasted in a limited role. Chris Evans is fine but it's hard to sell him as a struggling actor. The movie also seems extremely cynical about marriage and relationships in general. A stark contrast with Past Lives, which had a lot more emotional weight than this follow-up from Celine Song."

The early digital holds up better than Bamboozled, though the few night scenes are grainy as hell, but it works. Completely forgot PSH is in this and his uncomfortable attraction to young Anna Paquin. \"what are you trying to be, R Kelly?\" Way ahead of its time.

Ballerina doesn‚Äôt reach the heights of John Wick 4, but Ana de Armas acquits herself well in an extremely physically demanding role and the action scenes are wildly creative and varied. There‚Äôs one sequence near the end that had me absolutely giddy. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. It was worth the price of admission alone.

      "reviewText": "One of Joaquin's most hinged performances. Love his vulnerability. It's interesting rewatching this now that AI is close to the capabilities depicted here. The epidemic of loneliness that we find ourselves in, exasperated by a global pandemic, has led people to form relationships with chat bots. But in real life the AI is just repeating patterns. Watching this again with that in mind, are Samantha's feelings genuine, or is she merely repeating patterns? The idea makes the movie feel darker and less hopeful. I wonder how this movie will feel in another 12 years."

The hand-to-hand combat is shot soooo close up and with so many edits that it's practically incomprehensible. Still, I love this version of Batman, and Bale has a great mix of physicality and humor. The supporting cast is filled with heavy hitters, and Katie Holmes. I can't believe this came out 20 years ago."

      "reviewText": "Only my second time watching this, the first since it was in the theater. I don't remember it leaving much of an impression on me and, watching it again, it still didn't. The movie looks great, shot entirely on digital, and unlike earlier digital films like Bamboozled, it still holds up. All of the performances are pretty one-note and there's not much drama. It feels like it's just checking off boxes of Dillinger's exploits. His relationship with Billie felt so underdeveloped that the ending just doesn't hit as hard as it should. Probably my least favorite Mann film, unfortunately."

John Heard chews up every scene as Alex Cutter, who's trying to help Bridges solve a murder he witnessed. Lisa Eichhorn gives a strong performance as Cutter's wife, Maureen. Bridges' character is named Richard Bone and he lives up to his name in this one, looking like an off-brand Robert Redford. Somehow at no point does anyone call him Dick. Not sure this fully clicked for me and the ending was very late 70s/early 80s. But I dug the three leads and their complicated relationship."

I love Karen Allen's performance, and this might be my second favorite Jeff Bridges movie. I'd probably seen this a dozen times and only realized recently that it was a John Carpenter movie. What a run he had in the 80s. Just about every movie of his from that time is deeply embedded in my brain. This movie demands a lega-sequel."

He's remarkably candid for someone who lived such a private life, even when the subject turns to his arrest and its devastating impact on his career. I'm happy that he got a second chance to share his gifts, and they truly were a gift, with the world. Paul passed away before the documentary was finished, and you get a sense that there's a tiny bit of his story that's unresolved. But what's there is touching and nostalgic and inspiring all at once and made me feel incredibly grateful that I was around at the height of Pee-Wee Herman and everything else Paul gave us after."

A ton of exposition up front in case you've never seen a Mission Impossible movie, followed by a whole lot of mechanations to acquire the MacGuffin. That said, the third act is absolutely thrilling. The plane sequence is up there with some of the best set pieces in the franchise and, unlike the much publicized motorcycle jump from the last movie, they left plenty of footage for the theater and the stunt actually makes sense in the context of the movie. Overall a fairly satisfying conclusion and some fun additions to the supporting cast. Also one of the most clever (and subtle) IMAX aspect ratio transitions I've ever seen."

I haven't seen this since becoming aware of Aaron Sorkin but watching it again it makes perfect sense that he's responsible for the cracking dialogue in this. A Few Good Men is probably best known for Nicholson's explosive testimony but you gotta appreciate his seething disdain for Cruise's smug, young lawyer from their first scene together. And also Demi's hair, which is impeccable. I hope Cruise goes back to lawyer roles when he gets tired of risking his life for the sake of \"mass entertainment.\""

The effects here largely hold up, except for the CG humans, which didn‚Äôt look that great when this came out, and look even worse now. This remains one of the best Star Wars entries ‚Äî a thrilling heist movie with a great cast. Hoping we get to see a Donnie Yen prequel series someday. It tickles me to think that Americans who only know Yen from this and John Wick 4 may think he‚Äôs actually blind.

      "reviewText": "Revisiting this for the first time since the theater. Mann infuses the story with the tension and stakes of a crime thriller. Pacino and Crowe both give great, restrained performances. There‚Äôs a ton of great character actors in this, but Christopher Plummer really nails it as Mike Wallace. Could have been a little tighter but the performances kept me in it to the end."

Tim Allen is woefully miscast and Alan Rickman probably didn‚Äôt have to stretch too far to play a Shakespearean actor playing a role that‚Äôs beneath him.

      "reviewText": "My expectations were low going in, given that Marvel's post-End Game offerings have been mostly meh. But good on Marvel for making an effort to give at least a few of the characters in Thunderbolts some depth. The backstories of the team members are left to the die hards who suffered through a half dozen mediocre TV shows and spinoff movies. There's some fun action and dialogue. The reveal of the villain and the resolution of their arc (and the movie itself) happens extremely late and way too quickly. I don't know if I'm on board with the implications of the movie's ending. Thunderbolts may have had an easier time at the box office if they just called it what it is."

Outside of a couple fun set pieces, this is a pretty nondescript crime movie. Even the setting is some unknown, presumably American (based on the sheer number of guns) city, which looks like a combination of back lot sets and something made in Unreal Engine. This movie also has Timothy Olyphant, Forest Whitaker and Luis Guzman but pretty much squanders them. I really dug Apostle and Gangs of London, so I‚Äôm not sure what happened here but it‚Äôs not good."

There‚Äôs entire seasons of Amazon‚Äôs Reacher that are better than this. The fight scenes are pretty poorly shot and choreographed, especially in a post-John Wick world. And if Cruise did his own stunts, you wouldn‚Äôt know it. But Cruise is still Cruise and never fails to win me over, even in dreck like this. Plus I‚Äôve had a crush on Cobie Smulders since her How I Met Your Mother days.

But here it is, in glorious 4K all these years later and BOY, is this movie dumb. I love the subgenre of alien bad guy who has to be thwarted by a cop that doesn‚Äôt play by the rules (Predator 2, The Hidden). Bonus points if they team up with an alien cop (played here inexplicably by ESPN‚Äôs Jay Bilas, of all people). But this movie is just not good. I gave it two and a half stars out of pure nostalgia and because the human bad guys are a bunch of preppy white boys called, well, the White Boys, which seems pretty appropriate given the current state of affairs.¬†Somehow Brian Benben went on to star in HBO‚Äôs Dream On, married Madeline Stowe and then basically fucked right off the planet Earth as far as I know but good for him!"

      "reviewText": "I'm not sure this totally clicked for me (like a lot of Malick's work) but hot damn is it a gorgeous movie (like a lot of Malick's work). I didn't know what to make of it until reading Ebert's review, where he suggested that Linda, the little sister, is the main character and that's why the passion of the love triangle feels muted. That interpretation makes me want to revisit this again someday with that in mind. A good movie to watch if you feel like your job sucks. At least you don't have to deal with locusts."

I'm not sure each episode needed to be shot in one take but it's done masterfully here. If there are any sneaky edits they're extremely hard time spot, which makes the performances, particularly Stephen Graham and Owen Cooper's, that much more mesmerizing. At Second City they teach you \"today is the day,\" that every good story is the day something happens that changes its characters. Every episode of this series takes that to heart, even if it's not immediately obvious why we're seeing that day. Truly one of the must watch series of the year."

An interesting concept, but one that is better realized in A Ghost Story, which I also didn't love but featured Rooney Mara eating a whole pie in one take. Nothing as daring on display here and a little too much exposition. But it was good to see Cleary from The Knick as a suburban dad."

The cast is stacked with a who's who of famous actors, but like the Avengers movies, there's too many characters to give any meaningful time to develop. A lot of the action looks like stock footage, even though it's not. The movie gets more interesting in the last third as it focuses more on the plight of the soldiers on the ground and less on the logistics that the first third painfully drags out. It could have easily been an hour shorter and much improved if it just focused on the soldiers and didn't try to give equal screen time to all the higher-ups played by big name actors."

There's a sequence near the beginning where Li is battling the wife of a local merchant and must knock her to the ground to win the hand of their daughter that is just wildly outrageous. If that's not enough, Li's mom, played by Josephine Siao, takes a turn, posing as Li's older brother. Delightful. The 4k transfer looks great."

Hackman is good here, playing sleazy and desperate in equal measure but he just doesn't get enough screen time. Instead, Costner, who I've always felt is less an actor than a \"movie star\" runs around the Pentagon like a maniac for half the movie. Was hoping Hackman would be more adversarial but after the \"incident\" he's largely out of play until the end. Will Patton seems like he's in a completely different movie than everyone else but is maybe the best part."

      "reviewText": "Just a fun, sleazy, 80s crime movie featuring a pretty epic chase scene and one ridiculous turn after another. Willem Dafoe shines as an expert counterfeiter being pursued by two increasingly incompetent secret service agents. Not a great movie by any means but you can tell this probably inspired Tarantino and others to make similarly over-the-top crime capers."

Having watched Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore about a hundred times in college, I was pleasantly surprised by Sandler's dramatic turn back then. In the years since he's gotten worse at comedy and better at drama, even if he seldom does serious roles. I love the low-budget feel of this, Emily Watson's tender performance, and PSH, my god. To think of all the brilliant performances we've missed out on since his passing. Tragic. He's the perfect foil to Sandler's Barry Egan."

A modern-ish noir with lots of twists and turns and plot points that fall apart if you think about them for more than half a second. It's like a Lifetime movie made for Cinemax, with Denise Richards providing lots of male gaze bits. It's not a good movie by any means but it's pretty fun and trashy all the way through to the credits, where a bunch of stuff is revealed that happened off-camera."

Coleman Domingo gives a powerful performance and deserves all of the awards buzz. But the real standout for me was Clarence Maclin, one of the RTA members, who plays his vital arc with convincing nuance. A great pairing with Ghostlight, which also shows the redemptive power of theater."

This doc mostly covers his life after being paralyzed, his advocacy for the disabled, and the family, friends, and legacy he left behind. It had me in tears for most of the last 20 minutes. It's devastating to see our heroes fall but some manage to rise up and be more heroic than ever. Reeve was certainly one of those heroes."

The effects don‚Äôt hold up very well, particularly in the otherwise gorgeous 4K transfer, but this is such a well-crafted film and a template for Cameron‚Äôs later work that would go on to shatter box office records again and again."

      "reviewText": "I was interested in checking out this early work of Jonathan Glazer and it did not disappoint. From the very beginning, like Nicole Kidman, you‚Äôre not fully convinced whether 10-year-old Cameron Bright is actually the reincarnation of her dead husband. The score is both chilling and whimsical at times, and the cast features some great supporting actors, including Danny Huston, who plays Kidman‚Äôs (adult) fianc√©e. Watching him unravel as Kidman gets pulled deeper into this kid‚Äôs story culminates in such a delightful way. I really had no idea where this was going until the very end."

      "reviewText": "A short and sweet coming-of-age movie with a dash of magic(?), for lack of a better word. I was expecting it to lean a bit more into its initial premise but it keeps it at arms length. Aubrey Plaza and Maisy Stella couldn‚Äôt be more different but they make it work. And I randomly watched back-to-back movies with Percy Hynes White, who is charming and down-to-earth here. I was ready to write this off as just another breezy rom-com but the ending really landed for me and reminded me of one of my favorite movies that I won‚Äôt name because that would spoil this one."

      "reviewText": "Despite finding nearly every character in this movie unlikable and entitled, I was captivated the whole time. I would describe Anora as Pretty Woman meets Uncut Gems. Mikey Madison gives a really brave performance. Sean Baker again shows he‚Äôs a unique and incredibly talented filmmaker. I was surprised how funny this movie was. Also, it‚Äôs clear the actor that plays Vanya never played a video game in his life."

      "reviewText": "A really sweet and earnest coming-of-age movie. I also like movies and grew up in the video store age, so I found a lot to relate to. Isaiah Lehtinen is really great and believably awkward as the lead character, Lawrence. I almost wish the movie was longer than its 100 minute run time. I would have liked to see more of Lawrence and his manager Alana‚Äôs relationship develop. It seemed a little rushed."

      "reviewText": "This movie is painfully long but I have to give it props for its sheer ambition and scope. Kirk Douglas is such a charmer you can believe he‚Äôd be able to lead a slave uprising. Given recent events I was all jazzed when the slaves were eating the rich but uh, well, I guess we‚Äôre all truly fucked."
