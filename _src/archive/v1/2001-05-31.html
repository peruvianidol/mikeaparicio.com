  <p>Whazzup? As you can see, I changed the look of the site yet again. It turns out the inline frame I previously used to display my web log doesn't work in Nutscrape - err, Netscape. "What web log, Mike?"</p>

  <p>I also decided to go to a white background and jack up the text size a bit, as some people were having trouble reading the text. "I checked out your web site, Mike, but the text was so small I couldn't read it. So I didn't." (!)</p>
  
  <p>So, whaddaya think? Sign the guestbook and let me know. Signed it already? So what. Sign it again. :)</p>
  
  <p>Anyway, last weekend I drove down to San Diego to visit Ricardo. 1050 miles round trip in a Geo Metro - a drive I would not recommend. I managed to top out at 87 mph at one point, but the car was shaking violently, and I figured it was only a matter of seconds before the bottom dropped out of the friggin' car, so I slowed down a bit.</p>
  
  <p>San Diego was nice, but the weather was freakish to say the least. Foggy and overcast the entire weekend. Still, we had a good time. Visited La Jolla, Coronado, and Old Town, and hit a casino near Alpine. I've never lost $100 at blackjack so fast. But on the way out I dropped $15 bucks in a video poker machine and hit FOUR ACES on a $1 bet. $80 right there. So it wasn't a total loss.</p>
  
  <p>If you haven't seen the movie Memento already, go check it out. It's the BEST movie I've seen all year. Guy Pearce plays this guy searching for his wife's killer. Not too original, right? Well, the guy has a condition where he can't form new memories, and the whole movie is told backwards, from the point where he kills the man he thinks is responsible for his wife's death. It's excellent.</p>
  
  <p>As much as I'm enjoying being unemployed, I'm starting to get bored. (Not to mention broke.) I need to get back in the game. So I'm working on getting this site and my Hoopscity Live site looking spiffy so I can show them off to potential employers. If that doesn't work out, I hear Dave & Buster's is hiring...</p>
