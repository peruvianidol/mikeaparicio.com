  <p><strong>Ensim Corporation</strong><br>
  www.ensim.com<br>
  July 2000 - May 2001</p>

  <p>This was my first legit paid project. The latest version was the third version of the site in the nine months I worked there. The design was done by MediaTemple, but I structured the site and hand-coded all of the content. I used server side includes to separate the content from the design, so if the site changes again, they can just change the templates without having to mess with the whole site.</p>

  <p>I also developed some simple Perl scripts so people could input press releases and job openings to the site without knowing HTML. The press releases and jobs are displayed dynamically from a text file database. The site also uses Ultimate Bulletin Board and Subscribe Me Enterprise Edition, a couple of cool Perl-based programs for forums and mailing lists, respectively.</p>

  <p>Working for Ensim was quite an experience. It was the first time I haven't had complete control over the look and feel and the content of my work. Trying to accomplish their goals forced me to learn some cool new tricks, whereas with my previous work I tended to stick within my limitations. I got some good experience working with different groups of people and trying to make their visions a reality under a tight deadline. This job gave me some idea of what technologies to explore next, and given me access to software that I would have otherwise not been able to play with.</p>

  <p><strong>Hoopscity Live</strong><br>
  www.hoopscitylive.com<br>
  May 2000 - April 2001</p>

  <p><strong>UPDATE 5/14/01</strong> - <em>Due to the problems with the game and the consequential lack of enthusiasm, I temporarily shut down Hoopscity Live. I'm going to work on the scripts some more, and once EA puts out a playable game, I am planning on re-starting the league, perhaps on a smaller scale. I will have an archive of the site up shortly.</em></p>

  <p>This site started out as a re-design of the Chicago Cyber Basketball League web site. The CCBL was a NBA Live modem league that I got involved with over two years ago. Al, the guy who ran it, did a phenomenal job with the content, and he was totally dedicated. I really enjoyed participating in the league, and I offered to re-design the site with some new functionality that would automate a lot of the processes that were extremely time consuming, like the standings and stats.</p>

  <p>So I learned Perl in order handle the automation, and developed the entire site from the ground up. It took me a long time, but the finished product was really cool. But Al was missing in action for the longest time, and everyone was asking if the league was still on for it's third season. So I dedcided that if Al wasn't going to run the league, I would just carry on the tradition. No sense wasting all that time I spent working on the site.</p>

  <p>But then Al came back and decided he wanted to completely re-do everything, and disappeared again for awhile. I got fed up and decided to start my own league. Thus, Hoopscity Live was born. Al and I had a bit of a falling out, and shortly after that he put up his new CCBL site. But since then, the latest version of NBA Live has been released and there hasn't been an update ever since the site opened. It's too bad too, because Al was usually really on top of things, and the CCBL had a following of solid players. It was easily the best Live league around, if not one of the best online sports leagues ever.</p>

  <p>Now NBA Live 2001 is out, and it's a piece of crap. EA, the makers of the NBA Live series, left out a number of key features from Live 2000, including the ability to print stats in multiplayer games, which the scripts I spent months developing depended on for calcualating the stats. Worst of all, there's a multiplayer bug that is preventing almost a third of the league from even making it through a whole game.</p>

  <p>The league is moving along at a crawl, and despite the fact that the league is full and I have received e-mails from over 50 people asking to be on the waiting list, there are very few games being played.</p>

  <p>I wrote all the scripts for the site in Perl, which allow members to log in to a team admin page, where they can submit games, modify their rosters, and do other cool stuff. Eventually, I will have player trades automated and allow members to submit news stories and other features to the site.</p>

  <p>Next season, I'd like to be able to support concurrent leagues which are fully customizable. People would be able to pay a small fee to act as commish of their own league, and the scripts would automate every aspect of the league. The possibilities are endless, but I don't have the time to spend on such an ambitious project. And doing web design for a living now, the last thing I want to do when I get home is web design! And the lack of interest in the league certainly doesn't serve as inspriation to work on the site! Any Venture Capitalists out there?</p>

  <p>Right now, everyone is hoping EA comes out with a patch that will solve some of the major issues that are keeping people from really enjoying this game, and consequently, the league. The fate of Hoopscity Live really rests in the hands of EA at this point.</p>
